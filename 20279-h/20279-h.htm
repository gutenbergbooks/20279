FOREWORD<br>
<br>
This treatise on the diseases of domestic animals has been written with<br>
the primary purpose of placing in the hands of stock owners, a book of<br>
practical worth; hence, all technical language or terms, as used by the<br>
professional veterinarian, have been eliminated and only such language<br>
used as all may read and understand.<br>
<br>
The treatment suggested in each case is one I have used and found<br>
efficient in my many years of practice.<br>
<br>
If my readers will study and follow these directions carefully, they<br>
will save themselves much unnecessary loss. My confidence in this<br>
accomplishment is my reward for my labor in behalf of our dumb<br>
friends--the domestic animals.<br>

CHAPTER I<br>
<br>
ABORTION IN MARES<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Quality and quantity of food, poorly lighted, ventilated or<br>
drained stables, mare falling or slipping, sprains, kicks, hard, fast<br>
work or eating poisonous vegetation.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Mare will show signs of colic, the outer portion of the womb<br>
will be swollen, and if the colicky symptoms continue there will be a<br>
watery discharge and the membranes covering the foetus or foal will<br>
become noticeable. The animal strains when lying down or getting up.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Place the animal in comfortable quarters and blanket if<br>
chilly. When colicky pains are present treat the same as for spasmodic<br>
colic. To stop the straining and labor pains, give Tincture Opii one<br>
ounce, placing in gelatin capsule and give with capsule gun every two<br>
hours. One to two doses, however, are generally sufficient as the mare<br>
will either abort or the dangerous period will have passed. Keep the<br>
animal quiet and feed good nutritious food and pure water with chill<br>
taken off in small quantities but often. Disinfect the mare's quarters<br>
thoroughly. A good general tonic should be used in this condition, one<br>
that will strengthen and assist nature to throw off impurities from the<br>
blood, such as Sodium Hyposulphite, eight ounces; Potassi Iodide, one<br>
ounce. Make into eight powders and give one powder two or three times a<br>
day in drinking water.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
ABSCESS<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Bruises and injuries. Abscesses are also seen in complications<br>
with various diseases, perhaps the most common being distemper,<br>
laryngitis, etc.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Symptoms will vary, of course, according to the development of<br>
the disease. It may not be noticed at first, but upon careful<br>
examination small tortuous lines will be observed running from the point<br>
of irritation. In many cases a swelling is noticed which is hot, painful<br>
and throbbing and enlarges rapidly. In two or three days the soreness<br>
and heat gradually subside, but the abscess continues to grow. The hair<br>
falls from the affected parts and in a short time the abscess<br>
discharges, and the cavity gradually fills up and heals by granulation.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: In all cases hasten the repairing process as much as possible<br>
by applying hot water packs or hot bran, flaxseed or vegetable<br>
poultices. It is common with veterinarians to lance an abscess as soon<br>
as possible, but this requires skill and practice. I could not advise<br>
stockowners to perform this operation, as it requires exact knowledge of<br>
anatomy. It will usually be found a safe plan to encourage the full<br>
ripening of an abscess and allow it to open of its own accord, as it<br>
will heal much better and quicker and you take no chances of infection<br>
with an instrument. When opened do not squeeze the abscess to any<br>
extent, but press gently with clean hands or cloth, to remove the clot,<br>
and after this simply keep open by washing the abscess with a three per<br>
cent Carbolic Acid solution or Bichloride of Mercury, one part to one<br>
thousand parts of water. When an animal has abscesses it is well to give<br>
the following blood purifiers or internal antiseptics: Hyposulphite of<br>
Soda, eight ounces; Potassi Iodide, one ounce. Mix well and make into<br>
eight powders and give one powder twice daily in drinking water, or<br>
place in gelatin capsule and administer with capsule gun. This<br>
prescription will prevent the absorption of impurities from the abscess<br>
into the blood.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
ANEMIA<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Insufficient quality and quantity of food, insanitary<br>
surroundings, overwork, lack of exercise, drains on the system from<br>
acute or chronic diseases, worms; and can also be brought about by<br>
excessive heat, cold or pressure and lessening of the calibre of the<br>
arteries, poisons in the blood, suppurating wounds, repeated purging or<br>
bleedings.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: The visible mucous membranes of the nose, eyes and mouth are<br>
pale and sometimes have a yellow appearance. There is weakness,<br>
temperature of the body is lower than normal; pulse weak, legs cold to<br>
the feet, cold sweats are often present, breathing is quickened,<br>
especially in its last stages, animals tire easily, appetite and<br>
digestion become poor, swelling of the legs and the under surface of the<br>
abdomen, sheath and udder; the skin becomes rough and dry.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Remove the cause if possible in its first stages, or when<br>
first noticed. Give a physic of Calomel, two scruples; Aloin, two drams;<br>
Pulv. Gentian, two drams; Ginger, two drams. Place in gelatin capsule<br>
and give at one dose with capsule gun. Also, administer the following:<br>
Arsenious Acid, one dram; Ferri Sulphate, three ounces; Pulv. Gentian,<br>
three ounces; Pulv. Fenugreek Seed, three ounces, and Pulv. Anise Seed,<br>
three ounces. Mix well and make into twenty powders. Give one powder<br>
three times a day in feed, or place in gelatin capsule and give with<br>
capsule gun. Endeavor to build up the condition of the animal by the<br>
proper quantity and quality of food. Give pure water to drink, also<br>
provide sanitary conditions, as pure air, sunlight if possible. Turn out<br>
to grass when the weather is favorable. This treatment should be<br>
continued until the animal shows sign of improvement. However, the<br>
administration of physics should be given with great care so as not to<br>
produce superpurgation of the bowels (scours), as physics in this<br>
condition would tend to weaken the animal.<br>
<br>
It is to be borne in mind that pure water and nourishing food play a<br>
very important part in the treatment of Anemia.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
APHTHAE<br>
<br>
(Sore mouth and tongue--Pustular Stomatitis)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Superficial eruptions of the mucous membranes of the mouth and<br>
tongue. Frequently seen during convalescence of intermittent fever. This<br>
condition may also follow diseases of the digestive system, as<br>
Indigestion, etc., due to the blood absorbing toxic materials which<br>
break out in the form of pustules about the mouth and the whole<br>
alimentary canal (stomach and intestines).<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: The appetite is impaired, the mouth hot, the pulse not much<br>
affected as a rule, the temperature is slightly elevated, the animal is<br>
unable to masticate, and small vesicles appear and eventually terminate<br>
into pustules and burst and discharge a small amount of pus at the parts<br>
where the sores are the deepest.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Remove the cause if possible. Feed clean, soft food that is<br>
easily digested, as hot wheat bran mashes and steamed rolled oats,<br>
vegetables, etc. For a mouth-wash dissolve the following: One dram of<br>
Copper Sulphate, one dram of Chlorate of Potash, one dram of Boracic<br>
Acid in clean hot water, and syringe out the mouth two or three times a<br>
day. To the drinking water add one ounce of Hyposulphite of Soda twice a<br>
day. Where the appetite is impaired, administer the following: Pulv. Nux<br>
Vomica, Pulv. Gentian Root, Pulv. Iron, Pulv. Nitrate of Potash each two<br>
ounces. Mix and make into sixteen capsules and give one capsule three<br>
times a day with capsule gun.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
AZOTURIA<br>
<br>
CAUSE: This disease is usually due to work after a period of idleness,<br>
during which the animal has been liberally fed. It is found principally<br>
among highly-fed draft horses, and never in animals which are regularly<br>
worked. Light breeds of horses are also susceptible to this disease.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Attack is sudden and usually appears when the horse has<br>
traveled a short distance after having been stabled for a few days. The<br>
characteristic symptoms of this disease in an animal are: Excitability<br>
without apparent cause; actions seem to indicate injury of the hind<br>
quarters or loins. Animal has a peculiar goose-rumped look, owing to the<br>
muscles over the quarters being violently contracted, and are hard on<br>
pressure. One hind limb is generally advanced in front of the other, and<br>
on attempting to put weight on it, the hind quarters will drop until at<br>
times the hocks almost touch the ground. Sometimes a front leg is<br>
affected. The breathing is hurried. Animal is bathed in sweat, and is in<br>
such agony that it will seize almost anything with its teeth. Although<br>
the pulse is hard and frequent, the internal temperature, even in severe<br>
cases, seldom rises to any marked extent. The urine is dark-red to<br>
dirty-brown color. Owing to the stoppage of the worm-like movement of<br>
the bowels, there is generally constipation and retention of the urine.<br>
Sometimes the symptoms are milder than here described. In other cases<br>
the animal soon falls to the ground and continues to struggle in a<br>
delirious, half-paralyzed state until he dies. Sometimes this disease is<br>
mistaken for colic or acute indigestion, but it can be readily<br>
distinguished by the color of the urine.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: At the first symptom, stop and blanket the animal and let<br>
stand from one to three hours. Then move to the nearest shelter, keeping<br>
the animal as quiet and comfortable, as possible, as excitement<br>
aggravates the disease. Give Aloin, two drams; Ginger, two drams; in<br>
capsule, and administer with capsule gun. Also, give the following<br>
prescription: Potassi Nitrate, eight ounces; Sodii Bicarbonate, eight<br>
ounces; Potassi Iodide, one and one-half ounces. Mix well and make into<br>
thirty-two powders. Give one powder in drinking water every four hours,<br>
or in capsule, and give with capsule gun. Injections of soap and warm<br>
water per rectum are beneficial. Immerse a blanket in hot water and<br>
place over loins, then covering with a dry blanket, or, if this is<br>
impossible, apply the following liniment: Aqua Ammonia Fort., two<br>
ounces; Turpentine, two ounces; Sweet Oil, four ounces, and rub in like<br>
a shampoo over the loins. It may be necessary to draw off the urine,<br>
which is sometimes retained, and it is best to secure the services of a<br>
skilled veterinarian if, such is the case. Allow the animal to drink<br>
often, though in small quantities, of pure water with the chill taken<br>
off. If he is unable to stand on his feet it is well to turn him from<br>
side to side every six hours. It is also advisable to fill bags with hay<br>
and place against his shoulders to prevent him from lying flat on his<br>
side, as this may cause congestion of the lungs. Avoid drenching--it is<br>
dangerous. Should the animal show signs of uneasiness, give one ounce of<br>
Potassi Bromide in the drinking water every four hours until the<br>
excitement has subsided.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
BARRENNESS<br>
<br>
(Failure to Breed)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Contraction of the neck of the womb, growths on or in the<br>
ovaries, Whites or Leucorrhea. The first is the only form of barrenness<br>
which responds readily to treatment.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: A mare may come in heat normally, or stay in heat continually,<br>
or not come in heat at all.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Wash the hands in some antiseptic solution, such as Carbolic<br>
Acid or Bichloride of Mercury and see that the finger-nails are smooth.<br>
Grease the hand and arm with vaseline and proceed to dilate the neck of<br>
the womb. It may be difficult at first to insert the finger, but the<br>
opening will gradually enlarge. Work slowly and carefully until three<br>
fingers may be inserted. Breeding should follow about three hours after<br>
the womb has been dilated.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
BLEEDING AFTER CASTRATION<br>
<br>
If bleeding is from the little artery in the back portion of cord, it<br>
will generally stop of its own accord, but if it should continue to<br>
bleed for thirty minutes, I throw clean, cold water against the part.<br>
<br>
When bleeding is from the large artery in front of the cord, it is<br>
considered dangerous. The artery should be tied with a silk thread if<br>
possible, or twisted with a pair of forceps. Occasionally the artery<br>
cannot be found, in which case the hole in the scrotum should be plugged<br>
with a clean cloth saturated with Tincture of Iron, which will clot the<br>
blood and thus close the artery.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
BLOOD POISONING<br>
<br>
(Septicaemia or Pyemia)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: By the popular term, "Blood Poison," is meant a state of<br>
constitutional disturbance brought on by the entrance of putrid<br>
products--usually from a wound--into the blood. As a rule some pressure<br>
or inoculation is necessary for the introduction of poison into the<br>
circulation; hence, the necessity of free drainage and thorough<br>
disinfection of the wound, and the only hopeful cases are those in which<br>
by this means the supply of poison may be cut short.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: It is introduced through any wound or abrasion, whether due to<br>
injury, disease or by an operation. Signs of septic poison are heat,<br>
pain and swelling.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: It is necessary to see that the wound has good drainage, and<br>
wash with Carbolic Acid, one tablespoonful to one pint of distilled<br>
water or Bichloride of Mercury perhaps is the best in an infected wound.<br>
Apply one part to one thousand parts water. Also, give internally,<br>
Potassi Iodide, one ounce; Sodii Hyposulphite, eight ounces. Make into<br>
eight powders and give one powder two or three times a day in their<br>
drinking water or in capsule, and give with capsule gun. This is an<br>
intestinal antiseptic which is very valuable in the treatment of Blood<br>
Poisoning. Feed soft, laxative food and green grass, if possible.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
BONE SPAVIN<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Sprains of the hock from falling, slipping, jumping, pulling,<br>
traveling on uneven roads, falling through bridges, etc.<br>
<br>
Since Spavin is due to causes which come into existence after birth, it<br>
cannot be regarded as an hereditary disease. Hereditary predisposition,<br>
however, is largely accountable for its appearance. In the first place,<br>
the process of evolution in the horse, which is a single-toed animal,<br>
descended from a five-toed ancestor, predisposes him to suffer from<br>
union of the bones of the hock, just as it predisposes him to splints.<br>
The weaker the bones of the hock in comparison to the weight of the body<br>
the more inclined will the animal naturally be to contract Spavin.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Spasmodic catching up of the spavined limb, the moment the<br>
heel of the foot touches the ground, something after the manner of<br>
string-halt. At times the stiffness can be observed only when the animal<br>
is pushed from one side of the stall to the other. Spavin may often be<br>
detected when riding a horse down a steep hill from the fact that he<br>
drags the toe.<br>
<br>
The time of all others when a spavined horse will be apt to show his<br>
lameness will be the day following a hard day's work, and when he makes<br>
his first move from the stable in the morning is the proper moment for<br>
examination. Therefore, you should be prepared to form judgment quickly<br>
in these cases, for the longer the animal is trotted up and down the<br>
less lame will he generally become.<br>
<br>
We may have a visible sign of Spavin, swelling and hardness of the part,<br>
without lameness. If there be heat and tenderness on pressure, lameness<br>
will almost always be present. A careful comparison should be made of<br>
the hocks.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: An important factor in treating Spavin is keeping the animal<br>
quiet. This can be accomplished by placing the animal in a very narrow<br>
stall, carrying his feed and drinking water for a month or six weeks,<br>
and apply the following ointment: Red Iodide of Mercury, two drams;<br>
Pulverized Cantharides, three drams; Turpentine, thirty minims; Pine<br>
Tar, two drams; lard, two ounces. Mix well and rub in well for twenty<br>
minutes every forty-eight hours until three applications have been<br>
applied. Repeat this treatment again in two weeks, and grease well with<br>
lard.<br>
<br>
To cure a bone spavin it is necessary to unite two or more bones of the<br>
hock, and a fractured bone cannot unite if moved frequently. The same<br>
thing exists in bone spavin as in a fractured bone, only we have no<br>
ragged edges like that of a fractured bone to unite; therefore, keep the<br>
animal quiet. The younger the animal the easier the spavin is to treat,<br>
because the bones hardened with age contain more mineral matter and less<br>
flexible animal matter. While treating the animal, feed food that is<br>
easily digested.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
BOG SPAVIN<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Faulty conformation, slipping, falling through a bridge or<br>
culvert; large loosely built draft horses are prone to this blemish. Bog<br>
Spavin is hereditary, and you should, therefore, select a good type of<br>
animal for breeding purposes.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: A puffy swelling located in front and on the inside of the<br>
hock, varying from the size of a walnut to that of a man's fist. It very<br>
seldom causes lameness, but is a serious disfigurement and blemish.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Treatment is not satisfactory unless taken in its first<br>
stages and when the animal is young. If there is heat, pain and<br>
swelling, apply cold water or ice packs until the inflammation has left<br>
the parts. Then use the following prescription: Tincture of Iodine, two<br>
ounces; Gum Camphor, two ounces; Gasolene, one pint. Mix and shake well<br>
before applying with a nail or tooth brush twice a week.<br>
<br>
I may add that I have derived some wonderful results in treatment of Bog<br>
Spavin with the above mentioned prescription in both young and old<br>
animals, and perhaps it will be well to use it on both young and old<br>
animals in both acute and chronic forms of Bog Spavin.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
BOTS<br>
<br>
(Gastrophilis)<br>
<br>
Effect of Bots on the Health of Horses<br>
<br>
Although the presence of bots inside of a horse can be of no possible<br>
advantage to him, their presence, when in small numbers, as a rule<br>
produce very little or no ill effect in the horse, but if their number<br>
be large they cannot help being a source of debility and irritation. In<br>
practically all cases they produce indigestion, especially among young<br>
horses, also loss of condition, colic and even death.<br>
<br>
CAUSE: By the bot flies, which lay their eggs during the autumn on the<br>
skin and hair of the horses. These eggs on becoming hatched (in from 20<br>
to 25 days) produce small worms which irritate the skin by their<br>
movements and thus cause the horse to lick them off and to take them<br>
into his mouth, with the result that they gain access to various parts<br>
of the intestinal canal.&nbsp; The bot having selected its place of<br>
residence, attaches itself to the membranes lining the stomach and<br>
intestines, and derives its sustenance during its stay from the wound<br>
made by its hooks. In the summer the larva, after living inside the<br>
horse for about ten months, quits its hold and is expelled with the<br>
feces. Having concealed itself near the surface of the ground it becomes<br>
changed into a chrysalis from which the gadfly issues after an inactive<br>
existence of from thirty to forty days. The female fly becomes<br>
impregnated, lays her eggs on those parts of the horse from which they<br>
can be most easily licked off, and thus completes her cycle of<br>
existence.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Membranes about the eyes and mouth are very pale, as though<br>
the animal had lost a large quantity of blood; they will also be subject<br>
to colicky attacks, hair faded, dull, rough appearance, appetite poor<br>
and manifests a pot belly.<br>
<br>
PREVENTION: The best means of prevention are spraying your horses with<br>
the following fly repellant: Crude Carbolic Acid, 10%; Oil of Tar, 25%;<br>
Crude Oil, 65%. Mix thoroughly. This prevents the gadfly from depositing<br>
her eggs on the animals.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Withhold all food for twenty-four hours, then administer Oil<br>
of Turpentine, one ounce; place in a gelatin capsule and give with<br>
capsule gun. Follow this in six hours with a physic consisting of Aloin,<br>
two drams; Ginger, two drams. Place in a gelatin capsule and give with<br>
capsule gun. Repeat the above treatment in a week or ten days to insure<br>
the expulsion of Bots that might have escaped the first treatment.<br>

HACKNEY STALLION BAGTHORP SULTAN, FIRST INTERNATIONAL SHOW.<br>
Owned by Henry Fairfax of Virginia.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
BRONCHITIS<br>
<br>
CAUSE: It may be the result of debility, constitutional diseases,<br>
inhalation of impure air, smoke, or gases. Sometimes brought on by<br>
drenching by the escape of liquid into the windpipe; remember, a horse<br>
cannot breathe through his mouth. It may also be caused by sudden chill,<br>
foreign bodies in windpipe, micro organisms, or it may be associated<br>
with influenza, glanders, lung fever, etc.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Sore throat, loss of appetite, thirst, animal appears dull,<br>
membranes of the mouth, eyes and nose are reddened; urine is scanty and<br>
highly colored; cough dry and husky. After two or three days the cough<br>
becomes looser and, a frothy, sticky mucus of a yellowish color is<br>
present. This gradually becomes pus-like, after which the animal seems<br>
somewhat relieved. In the first stages the pulse is soft and weak, but<br>
frequently the temperature is high, ranging from 105 to 106 degrees F.;<br>
the breathing is quick and more or less difficult.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Place the horse in a clean, comfortable, well ventilated<br>
stall, exclude drafts, blanket if the weather is chilly. Also, hand rub<br>
the legs and bandage them. Inhalations from steam of hot water and<br>
Turpentine are beneficial. Also administer Chlorate of Potassi, two<br>
ounces; Nitrate of Potash, two ounces; Tannic Acid, one ounce. Mix this<br>
with a pint of black-strap molasses and give about one tablespoonful<br>
well back on the tongue with a wooden paddle every six hours. In severe<br>
attacks of Bronchitis it is well to apply a liniment consisting of<br>
Turpentine, Aqua-Ammonia Fort., and raw Linseed Oil, each four ounces;<br>
mix well and apply to the throat and down the windpipe once or twice a<br>
day. The animal should be fed on soft food, such as hot bran mashes,<br>
grass, carrots, kale, apples or steamed rolled oats. After the acute<br>
symptoms of the disease disappear, give Pulverized Gentian Root, one<br>
ounce; Nux Vomica, two ounces; Nitrate of Potash, three ounces;<br>
Pulverized Fenugreek Seed, six ounces. Mix and give one tablespoonful<br>
three times a day in the feed or in a gelatin capsule and administer<br>
with a capsule gun.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CAPPED KNEE<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Bruises from pawing or striking objects with the knee, falling on<br>
the ground, etc., are perhaps the most common causes.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: It may be a simple bruise, or it may be a severe wound. There<br>
is always swelling, heat and pain present. The joint becomes stiff and<br>
interferes with the movement of the leg. Under careful treatment the<br>
swelling and enlargement disappear.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Relieve the inflammation and clean the wound by fomenting<br>
with hot water, to which add a few drops of Carbolic Acid. If the wound<br>
is very large, trim off the ragged edges with a pair of scissors and<br>
apply the following: Boracic Acid, two ounces; Iodoform, one ounce;<br>
Tannic Acid, one ounce. Powder finely, mix and apply two or three times<br>
a day. If the skin is not broken, apply cold water or ice packs until<br>
the inflammation has subsided; then use the following: Tincture of<br>
Iodine, one ounce; Camphor, two ounces, and Gasolene, eight ounces.<br>
Apply with nail or toothbrush every thirty-six hours until the<br>
enlargement has disappeared.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CAPPED HOCK<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Some horses have the habit of rubbing or striking their hocks<br>
against the partition of their stalls. May also be produced by kicks<br>
from other horses, or hocks may be bruised by the singletree.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: An enlargement at the point of the hock, which may run up<br>
along the tendons and muscles of the leg. Repeated injuries cause the<br>
hock to enlarge and become flabby, and in some cases it contains a<br>
bloody serum or pus.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Do not attempt to lance the puffy swelling on the point of<br>
the hock, as you may produce an open joint, which is very difficult to<br>
treat, and chances are that you would lose the animal.<br>
<br>
The treatment that I would recommend is to find out the true cause and<br>
remove it. When the puffy swelling is swollen, hot and painful, apply<br>
cold water or ice packs. When the heat and pain have subsided apply the<br>
following: Tincture of Iodine, two ounces; Gum Camphor, two ounces,<br>
dissolved in one pint of Gasolene. Shake the contents of the bottle<br>
before using each time and apply with a nail or toothbrush every<br>
forty-eight hours. This is very penetrating and will remove the<br>
enlargement or absorb fluids that might have accumulated from the result<br>
of the bruise.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHOKING<br>
<br>
This term applies to obstruction of the gullet as well as that of the<br>
windpipe.<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Too rapid eating, by which pieces of carrots or other roots, or a<br>
quantity of dry food become lodged in the gullet. Although obstructions<br>
of the windpipe caused while drenching, or food entering the lungs, will<br>
kill an animal in a very short time, obstructions in the gullet may not<br>
prove fatal for several days.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: No time should be lost in attempting to remove the<br>
obstruction from the gullet. It may be dislodged by gently manipulating<br>
the gullet. If unsuccessful in dislodging the obstruction in this<br>
manner, secure the services of a competent veterinarian. He will use a<br>
probang, an instrument made for this purpose, or inject Sweet or Olive<br>
Oil into the gullet with a hypodermic syringe, or give hypodermic<br>
injections of Arecoline. In administering drenches with the object of<br>
dislodging obstructions in the gullet, you must remember that the<br>
liquids used are apt to go the wrong way, that is to say, enter the<br>
lungs, and give rise to lung complications, as lung fever, bronchitis,<br>
etc. Obstructions of solid substance in the windpipe generally cause<br>
death very shortly. When liquids enter the lungs, death is not so apt to<br>
occur, as the animal may live several days, and sometimes even get well.<br>
They should be treated the same as for lung fever.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CRACKED HEELS<br>
<br>
CAUSE: There is little doubt in my mind that ammonia, which is so<br>
plentifully found in ill-kept stables, is the chief cause of cracked<br>
heels. The action of ammonia on the skin renders it soft and pulpy, and<br>
diminishes its strength by separating the layers of which it is<br>
composed.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: When inflammation is set up in the part, the secretion of<br>
natural oil is interfered with and cracks usually occur in the place<br>
where the skin becomes wrinkled when the pastern joint is bent. The<br>
discharge from cracked heels has an offensive smell. In early stages<br>
there is extreme heat and swelling, there is pain and lameness, which<br>
usually disappear as the case becomes chronic.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Keep the affected parts clean as possible, if there is<br>
extreme inflammation present. Apply hot poultice made from bran or<br>
flaxseed meal. When the inflammation subsides, apply Zinc Ointment twice<br>
daily. Before applying each application of ointment, wash with Warm<br>
Water and Castile Soap. Feed carrots, green grass, if possible, also hot<br>
bran mashes or steam rolled oats each morning. Sometimes it is well to<br>
give a physic, and I would recommend Aloin, one and one-half drams;<br>
Ginger, two drams. A physic has very good effect in reducing the<br>
swelling of the legs.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
COFFIN-JOINT LAMENESS<br>
<br>
(Navicular Disease)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Driving young animals on hard roads. Always found in the front<br>
feet, owing no doubt to the fact the front feet support largely the<br>
weight of the body.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: The symptoms are very hard to detect. As a rule the animal<br>
will point the affected foot when at rest even before there is any<br>
lameness present. While at work he apparently goes sound, but when<br>
placed in the stable, or when stopped on hard ground, one foot will be<br>
set out in front of the other and resting on the toe. It will be noticed<br>
that the animal takes a few lame steps and then goes well again. Again<br>
he may be lame for a day, or he may leave the stable in the morning<br>
apparently well and sound and go lame during the day. In the course of<br>
time he will develop a severe case of lameness, which may last for five<br>
or six days. These spells are intermittent and finally he becomes<br>
permanently lame, and the more he is driven the greater the lameness,<br>
and he steps short, wears the toe of the shoe, stumbles, falls on his<br>
knees when the road is rough. Sometimes both front feet are affected and<br>
the shoulders will be stiff. When put to work he sweats from pain; there<br>
will be extreme heat about the foot, and he will flinch from pressure.<br>
<br>
Comparatively few recoveries are made from this disease.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: First remove the shoe. If the foot is inflamed, poultice with<br>
hot bran or flaxseed meal. After the inflammation disappears, clean the<br>
foot well, clip the hair from around the top of the hoof and use the<br>
following: Red Iodide of Mercury, two drams; Pulverized Cantharides,<br>
four drams; Turpentine, thirty drops; Lard, two ounces. Mix well and<br>
apply every forty-eight hours, rubbing in well for twenty minutes each<br>
time. After three or four applications have been applied, turn the<br>
animal out to pasture. Repeat this treatment again in a month or so.<br>
Animals affected with this disease should be put to slow and easy work<br>
on soft ground, and carefully shod. This disease is unsatisfactorily<br>
treated and only a few cases recover when the best care is taken.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CORNS<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Dry feet, increased pressure from ill fitting shoes, or high<br>
heeled shoes, which tend to contract the heels and produce corns. Wide<br>
flat feet are predisposed to bruises which terminate in corns.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Lameness, or as the old saying goes, "The animal will go<br>
tenderfooted." When standing the animal is generally very restless, they<br>
paw their bedding behind them at night. Tapping or pressure on the foot<br>
will assist in locating a corn.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Discover the true cause of the corn and remove it if<br>
possible. Take away all pressure from over the corn and turn the animal<br>
out in some damp pasture. If this cannot be done, put on a flat "bar"<br>
shoe, packing the sole of the foot with Pine Tar and Oakum; then place a<br>
leather between the foot and shoe. Repeat this application every two<br>
weeks, as this will keep the sole soft and flexible, and with proper<br>
shoeing your animal will be relieved of corns.<br>
<br>
Frequently coffin-joint lameness or navicular disease is mistaken for<br>
corns.<br>
<br>

who Sired Baron O'Buchlyvie, who was sold for $45,000.00, the Highest<br>
Price ever paid for a Draft Stallion.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CONSTIPATION<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Indigestible foods, irregular feeding, lack of, or too much,<br>
exercise, insufficient secretion of digestive materials, strictures,<br>
ruptures, paralysis, worms, folding and twisting of the intestines,<br>
which frequently occurs in old age.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: The animal cannot expel the contents of the intestines, which<br>
frequently causes colicky pains. Death from this form of constipation is<br>
generally due to rupture of the intestines, when due to indigestible<br>
foods or irregular feeding. Lack of, or too much, exercise seldom<br>
produces death, although the animal may not pass any fecal matter for a<br>
week.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Give a capsule containing Aloin, two drams, and Pulverized<br>
Ginger, two drams, every eighteen hours until the animal has a movement<br>
of the bowels. Then give the following tonic: Pulverized Nux Vomica, two<br>
ounces; Pulverized Gentian Root, two ounces; Pulverized Fenugreek Seed,<br>
four ounces. Mix well and give one tablespoonful in feed three times a<br>
day. If the animal refuses to eat it in the feed, place one<br>
tablespoonful in gelatin capsule and administer with capsule gun. This<br>
will stimulate the worm-like movement of the bowels and strengthen the<br>
heart action.<br>
<br>
Give the animal all the water it will drink. If the water is cold, take<br>
the chill off by warming or adding warm water. If the animal will eat,<br>
feed food that is easily digested, such as grass, carrots, turnips,<br>
potatoes and apples, but do not feed too large a quantity at one time.<br>
Hot bran mashes or steamed rolled oats are very nourishing and easily<br>
digested. Rectal injections of Soap and Turpentine in small quantities,<br>
added to warm&nbsp; water, are very beneficial, and I would recommend
their<br>
use. It is advisable to elevate the animal's hind parts when giving<br>
rectal injections, as compelling the animal to stand with its head lower<br>
than its hind parts will cause the animal to retain the injection much<br>
longer, consequently it does its intended work much better.<br>
<br>
If due to worms, fast the animal for twenty-four hours and give<br>
Barbadoes Aloes, three drams; Calomel, one dram; Ferri Sulphate, two<br>
drams; Antimony Tartrate, two drams. Place in gelatin capsule and give<br>
with capsule gun, This dose should be repeated in ten days to insure the<br>
expulsion of newly hatched worms.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
COLD<br>
<br>
(Nasal Catarrh)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Atmospheric changes common in the spring and fall; animal allowed<br>
to chill when standing in a draft, or driven when the system is in a<br>
poor condition. It is also produced by inhaling irritating gases, smoke,<br>
drenching through the nose, dusty hay or grain that contains infectious<br>
matter.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Animal is stupid, does not take food very freely, hair stands<br>
and looks dusty, throat becomes sore, pulse is not greatly affected.<br>
There may be a slight rise of temperature, say 101 to 103 degrees F.<br>
After a day or two there will be a discharge of mucus from the nostrils<br>
which may be offensive to the smell. There is generally an increased<br>
flow of urine. The breathing is not much affected.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Make the animal as comfortable as possible by placing in a<br>
clean stall with pure air, but avoid drafts. Blanket if the weather is<br>
chilly and give the following prescription: Chloride of Potash, two<br>
ounces; Nitrate of Potash, four ounces. Mix these well in a pint of Pine<br>
Tar and place about one tablespoonful of the mixture as far back on the<br>
tongue as possible every six hours. Relief is very certain if this<br>
treatment is given in the first stages. If not it will become chronic<br>
and terminate into nasal gleet, or lung complications.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
COUGH<br>
<br>
(Acute and Chronic)<br>
<br>
As a cough is a symptom of various diseases, these in addition to the<br>
cough should be treated.<br>
<br>
KINDS OF COUGH: Many writers give several different varieties, but for<br>
sake of convenience I will divide them into two forms, namely: Acute and<br>
Chronic.<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Acute Coughs are generally due to sudden exposure to cold, drafts<br>
and are the forerunning symptom of a disease of the organs of breathing.<br>
<br>
Chronic Coughs are associated with, and often a result of, sore throat,<br>
lung fever, pleurisy, bronchitis, broken wind, influenza, nasal gleet,<br>
catarrh, glanders, heaves and distemper.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Under each disease of which a cough is a symptom, I have also<br>
prescribed to include its suppression. The following prescription is<br>
reasonable in price, yet very effective in all forms of cough: Tannic<br>
Acid, one ounce; Potassi Chlorate, four ounces; Potassi Nitrate, four<br>
ounces. Powder well and mix with Black Strap Molasses, one pint; placing<br>
container retaining the above in hot water assists in dissolving. When<br>
this is thoroughly mixed add Pine Tar one pint, and place one<br>
tablespoonful well back on the tongue with a wooden paddle every three<br>
or four hours, according to the severity of the cough.<br>
<br>
Sometimes a liniment applied to the throat and windpipe has a good<br>
effect, and I would recommend the following on account of its<br>
penetrating qualities: Aqua Ammonia Fort., two ounces; Turpentine, two<br>
ounces; Raw Linseed Oil, four ounces. Mix and apply twice daily, shaking<br>
the contents of the bottle well before using.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
COLT CONSTIPATION<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Improper digestion of its mother's milk, especially when<br>
overheated or not allowed to nurse enough.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: The colt appears stupid; does not care to move about, but lies<br>
flat on either side and shows signs of great pain.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Give two tablespoonfuls of Cascara Sagrada. Great care must<br>
be exercised in administering the medicine to place it well back on the<br>
tongue; do not hold the nose high or some of the liquid may enter the<br>
lungs; it is much better to waste some of the medicine. One of the most<br>
important factors in the treatment of Colt Constipation is rectal<br>
injections; they relieve temperature, gases, and pain, promoting the<br>
worm-like action of the bowels and liquefying their contents.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
COLT DIARRHOEA<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Specific infection, the action of which is favored by insanitary<br>
conditions, irregular feeding, or permitting the colt to nurse when the<br>
mother is overheated or out of condition.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Frequent watery discharges, sometimes tinged with blood, and<br>
as the disease progresses the colt shows signs of great pain. If not<br>
treated promptly, the disease will terminate fatally in the course of<br>
six or ten days.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Determine the exact cause, if possible, and remove it. If the<br>
colt has not been weaned, attention should at once be given the mare,<br>
and if anything is wrong with her, it may be best to take the little<br>
patient away from its mother and feed it on cow's milk sweetened with<br>
sugar. Give two tablespoonfuls of Castor Oil on the tongue; this will<br>
remove the irritant within the bowels. The following prescription is a<br>
very reliable remedy: Protan, three ounces; Pulv. Ginger, four drams;<br>
Zinc Sulphocarbolates, four grains. Mix and make into twelve powders;<br>
give one powder on the tongue every four hours, effecting a cure within<br>
a few days. Do not pull the tongue, or hold the head too high. Permit<br>
the animal to swallow slowly. Remember that sanitary surroundings are<br>
essential in the treatment of all diseases.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CURB<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Faulty conformation of the hind legs; that is to say, if an<br>
animal has crooked legs, a slight sprain from slipping or jumping will<br>
produce Curb. In cases where an animal has well proportioned limbs, and<br>
is afflicted with Curb, it is caused by a rupture of the small ligament<br>
or cord situated just back of the hock.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: A swelling will be noticed on the back part of the hock. At<br>
first the animal is lame and the enlargement is hot and painful. After a<br>
few days' rest the inflammation will partially subside and the<br>
enlargement can be plainly seen. When the animal is walked about he may<br>
be very lame at the start, but this will disappear as he is moved.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: When the Curb is hot and painful, it is well to apply ice<br>
packs or cold water to the part. When the inflammation subsides, apply<br>
Red Iodide of Mercury, two drams; Lard, two ounces. Mix and rub in well<br>
for twenty minutes; repeat every forty-eight hours until three<br>
applications are applied. If the Curb is of long standing it is more<br>
difficult to treat, in which case the above treatment should be repeated<br>
again in two or three months. Do not use the animal in drawing heavy<br>
loads, or drive on slippery roads, for six months. Give the blister time<br>
to strengthen the ruptured tendons. A high-heeled shoe is often<br>
valuable in relieving tendons of their tension.<br>

<br>
DIARRHOEA<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Sudden change of food, frozen food, soft food, unwholesome food,<br>
stagnant water, or drinking large quantities of water at one time,<br>
purgative medicines, or it may be associated with blood diseases, lung<br>
and intestinal affections, or produced by micro-organisms. Many horses,<br>
particularly slack loined, slight, "washy" animals, purge if worked or<br>
excited, as may be observed among race horses when taken to a race<br>
course. Diarrhoea may also be due to worms, or it may be merely an<br>
effort on the part of nature to expel some irritant matter from the<br>
bowels or from the blood, in which case it should on no account be<br>
prematurely checked.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Frequent loose evacuations of the intestines, with or without<br>
pronounced abdominal pain; generally, loss of appetite, animal looks<br>
gaunt and the hair rough.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Keep the animal quiet, comfortably stabled and warmly<br>
blanketed. Give pure water to drink, often, but in small quantities. If<br>
the animal will eat, feed moderately on clean food, as rolled oats and<br>
dry bran. Also, give the following prescription: Protan, three ounces;<br>
Zinc Sulphocarbolates, ten grains; Creosote, one dram; Powdered Ginger,<br>
two ounces; Powdered Gum Catechu, six drams; Powdered Gum Camphor,<br>
one-half dram. Mix and make eight powders. Place one powder in gelatin<br>
capsule and give with capsule gun, or the same sized dose dissolved in a<br>
pint of water and used as a drench. However, be very careful when<br>
drenching an animal. It is dangerous. This prescription will not only<br>
check the diarrhoea, but will tone the muscular fibres of the intestines<br>
which aid in throwing off these irritant matters from the system. If the<br>
horse shows colicky pains, administer the same treatment as that<br>
recommended for colic. It is well to give the following treatment in the<br>
convalescing stages of diarrhoea: Pulv. Gentian Root, four ounces; Ferri<br>
Sulphate, four ounces; Pulv. Nux Vomica, four ounces; Pulv. Fenugreek<br>
Seed, eight ounces. Mix and give one heaping tablespoonful three times<br>
daily in feed. This facilitates digestion by stimulating the flow of<br>
gastric juices.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
DISTEMPER<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Distemper is placed among the germ diseases, and is produced by<br>
the Streptococcus of Schutz. It is contagious and a number of animals in<br>
the same stable may become affected at the same time. It is supposed to<br>
attack an animal but once, but it may be contracted a second time. May<br>
occur at any time of the year.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: The animal will first appear dull, and show loss of appetite;<br>
and the hair will look dull and rough. There will be a watery discharge<br>
from the nose, and in a day or so a lump will appear between the jaws;<br>
the animal keeps his head in a peculiar position; saliva runs from its<br>
mouth; the pulse will be a little faster than normal. The breathing will<br>
become more rapid and the lump between the jaws will get larger. This<br>
lump, or tumor, may form in other parts of the body, on the shoulder, in<br>
the groin, lungs or intestines. It usually causes death if it cannot be<br>
absorbed. This is called irregular distemper. A determined effort should<br>
be made to draw the lump, or tumor, to a head as soon as possible.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Place the horse in a clean, well-ventilated and lighted<br>
stall, excluding all drafts, blanket the animal, hand rub the legs and<br>
bandage them; give inhalations of steam from Hot Water and Turpentine. A<br>
good method for heating water for this purpose is to place hot stones or<br>
bricks in the water and Turpentine. This will relieve the hard<br>
breathing. Remember a horse cannot breathe through his mouth, therefore,<br>
liquid drenches are dangerous. A paste made from Potassi Chlorate, two<br>
ounces; Potassi Nitrate, two ounces, dissolved in a pint of warm<br>
molasses and given well back on the tongue in tablespoonful doses every<br>
two or three hours is very beneficial. A liniment made from equal parts<br>
of Aqua Ammonia Fort., Turpentine and Sweet Oil should be applied, every<br>
morning over the enlargement that appears in the region of the throat.<br>
If the enlargement fails to come to a head, secure the services of an<br>
accomplished veterinarian, who will use a clean instrument for lancing<br>
purposes.<br>
<br>
After an attack of distemper your horse is generally run down in<br>
condition. Give the following: Potassi Nitrate, four ounces; Pulv.<br>
Gentian Root, four ounces; Pulv. Anise Seed, eight ounces. Make into<br>
thirty-two powders and give one powder three times daily in feed.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
DROPSY<br>
<br>
(Of the Belly, Chest, Sheath, Udder and Legs)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Poor circulation; kidneys not working properly; lack of exercise;<br>
diseases of the lungs, liver, heart, womb or sheath. Mares heavy with<br>
foal often have dropsical swellings.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Swelling seldom contains fluid, although sometimes a sticky<br>
serum oozes through the skin; fingers pressed against the swollen parts<br>
leave impressions.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Avoid giving physics in this condition when possible,<br>
especially to mares with foal. Feed laxative food, as hot bran mashes,<br>
green grass, carrots, potatoes, etc.; also the following mixture:<br>
Potassi Iodide, two ounces; Potassi Nitrate, four ounces; Chloride of<br>
Potash, two ounces. Mix and make into sixteen powders. Place one powder<br>
in their drinking water three times a day. Exercise the animal as much<br>
as possible and you will derive good results from this treatment within<br>
a week or so.<br>
<br>
I may add that in the above affection it is a bad practice to apply hot<br>
applications, as the chances are it would produce a sloughing of the<br>
skin.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
ECZEMA<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Anything that interferes with the healthy action of the skin, as<br>
checked sweating, irritation from dirty blankets or harness, or from<br>
accumulation of dirt on the skin through want of grooming, errors in<br>
feeding, overheat, or by infection. In some cases the cause seems to be<br>
constitutional; in others, local. Though the disease is not parasitic in<br>
character, it is probable that when once contracted the diseased parts<br>
may be become infected.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Slight dryness and eruptions that may affect the head, ears,<br>
neck, shoulders, flanks, inside of thighs and root of the tail, followed<br>
by vesicles or pimples which burst and discharge, or the contents may be<br>
absorbed. The animal will rub against the stall, manger, or any other<br>
object he can reach, until the parts are very sore, or if worked, he<br>
will rub himself violently when unharnessed.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Give Fowler's Solution of Arsenic, one tablespoonful morning<br>
and night on their feed; also give a physic consisting of two drams of<br>
Aloin and two drams of Pulverized Ginger in gelatin capsule. Give at one<br>
dose. One physic is all that is necessary to cool out the blood, which<br>
will assist materially in treating Eczema. Also, apply Zinc Ointment<br>
twice daily over the vesicles or pimples which will appear on the skin.<br>
Also, feed easily digested food if possible, such as carrots, apples,<br>
grass, hot bran mashes and steamed rolled oats, and keep the animal<br>
clean and groom carefully with clean combs and brushes.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
EYE DISEASES<br>
<br>
CONJUNCTIVITIS, or Inflammation of the superficial structure of the eye.<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Direct or indirect injury to the eye, as a blow from a whip,<br>
dust, sand or chaff in the eye, or it may be due to extreme cold, heat,<br>
or foul air.<br>
<br>
<br>
Inflammation of the Membrane of Nictitans<br>
<br>
The membrane of nictation is an accessory eyelid common to all domestic<br>
animals, the purpose of which is to remove foreign substances from the<br>
eye in much the same manner as we use the hand.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Conjunctivitis and inflammation of the membranes of nictitans<br>
are very much the same. A partial or complete closure of the eye, and a<br>
watery discharge due to overstimulation of the lachrymal glands, the<br>
fluid being secreted so abundantly that it is impossible for the tear<br>
duct to carry it away; hence, there will be a continuous overflow of<br>
tears down the horse's face. The formation of a film or scum over the<br>
eye need not cause alarm if the eye shows no sign of puncture.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Examine the eye carefully and remove any foreign body with<br>
clean cloth or feather and apply the following: Yellow Oxide of Mercury,<br>
three grains; Lanolin, one ounce. Mix well together and apply to the eye<br>
three or four times daily. Avoid the use of liquid medicines, as they<br>
are hard to apply, and the animal throws them out by shaking the head.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
FISTULOUS WITHERS<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Fistulous Withers are seen mostly in horses that have a thick<br>
neck as well as those that are very high in the withers, or among saddle<br>
horses, those that are very low on the withers, the saddle here riding<br>
forward and bruising the parts. They are often caused by ill-fitting<br>
collars or saddles, by direct injury from blows, and from the horse<br>
rolling upon rough, sharp stones. In this location, the ulcer of the<br>
skin or a simple abscess, if not properly and punctually treated, may<br>
terminate into Fistula. The pus burrows and finds lodgment deep down<br>
between the muscles, and escapes only when the sinuses become surcharged<br>
when, during motion of the muscles, the pus is forced to the surface.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: These of course will vary according to the progress made by<br>
the Fistula. Following an injury we may often notice soreness or<br>
stiffness of the front legs, and upon careful examination of the withers<br>
we will see small tortuous lines running from the point of irritation<br>
downwards and backwards over the region of the shoulder. The stiffness<br>
of the limbs may disappear at this time, and heat and soreness of the<br>
parts may become less noticeable, but the swelling of the shoulders<br>
continues to enlarge. The swelling may often have the form of a running<br>
ulcer, or its contents may dry up and leave a tumor, which gradually<br>
develops the common characteristic of a fistulous tumor. When the<br>
enlargement has an opening, we should carefully examine the pus cavity,<br>
as upon this condition will wholly depend our treatment.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Keep the animal as quiet as possible, as any movements of the<br>
limbs cause the pus to spread between the lines of the muscles and form<br>
larger abscesses or tumors. When the bone becomes diseased, it is very<br>
difficult to effect a cure, especially where the pus burrows back of the<br>
Scapula (Shoulder Blade). In case the abscess is newly formed, and close<br>
to the surface, syringing out with a solution made from Bichloride of<br>
Mercury, five grains to one ounce of water, generally causes the white<br>
fibrous tissue to slough away and the parts to heal rapidly. If the<br>
abscess is deep, and the bones become diseased, the pus will have a very<br>
offensive odor, and I would recommend the services of a competent<br>
Veterinarian to remove all diseased portions of bone or muscle.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
FILARIAE<br>
<br>
(Thread-like Worm)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Drinking stagnant water, or eating hay gathered from swamps or<br>
marshy land. When full grown, the worm measures from two to six inches<br>
in length; the tail is more or less curved. They are found in the lung<br>
cavity, the heart sac, and the intestinal cavity, from which they<br>
sometimes descend into the sac containing the testicles. Animals said to<br>
have a snake in the eye have been exhibited as curiosities; in all cases<br>
the simulated snake was nothing more than the Filariae.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Colicky spells; poor appetite, indigestion, pot-belly, rough<br>
coat; swelling of the sheath, legs, and the lower surface of the belly.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Prevention is the only treatment, for when the worms once<br>
enter the digestive canal, it is impossible to remove them.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
FOUNDER<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Overeating or drinking--in fact, any irritation of the stomach or<br>
intestines is liable to be followed by Founder, owing to the similarity<br>
in the sensitive structure of the foot, skin, and mucous membranes.<br>
Horses with weak feet are predisposed to Founder, but it may also occur<br>
in strong-footed animals. Founder is also produced by driving an animal<br>
on a hot summer day and then placing in the stable where the sweat is<br>
suddenly checked by drafts, etc.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: The horse is stiff, and moves with great difficulty; he will<br>
generally, though not always, remain standing. Throws weight upon the<br>
heel of the foot to relieve the toe, and if an effort is made to back<br>
him he will drag his feet. Excessive heat is present at the top of the<br>
hoof, and a throbbing of the arteries may be felt. When the fore feet<br>
only are affected, the horse will relieve them of as much weight as<br>
possible when walking by placing the hind feet well under the body,<br>
which results in a peculiar jumping motion. Founder may occur in all<br>
four feet, but the fore feet are more often affected than the hind ones.<br>
Mares sometimes founder after giving birth to a colt, due to<br>
inflammation of the womb; symptoms correspond to those of common<br>
Founder. Founder may be mistaken for disease of the lungs or kidneys,<br>
owing to the standing position and arched back. Veterinarians have been<br>
known to mistake it for lung fever; the services of such men are<br>
dangerous and should be avoided.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: In all cases of Founder, administer Potassi Iodide, one<br>
ounce; Soda Bicarbonate, four ounces; Potassi Nitrate, four ounces. Mix<br>
and give one tablespoonful in drinking water every six hours. If the<br>
animal will not take it in its water, place in gelatin capsule and give<br>
with capsule gun.<br>
<br>
Find out the true cause of the disease, if possible, and perhaps a<br>
physic will be indicated, containing Aloin, two drams; Ginger, two<br>
drams; place it in a capsule and give with capsule gun. If desired<br>
results are not obtained in eighteen hours, repeat the dose until there<br>
is an action of the bowels. Founder following excessive irritation of<br>
the stomach and intestines, or mares heavy with foal, should not receive<br>
physics. Feed food that is easily digested, as carrots, kale, apples,<br>
potatoes, hot bran mashes, or steamed rolled oats, etc.<br>
<br>
It is well to elevate the hind quarters and give rectal injections of<br>
Warm Water and Glycerine. Stand in mud or water, or apply bags<br>
containing mud, bran or ice; in fact, anything that will have a cool,<br>
moist effect on the feet.<br>
<br>
After the inflammation of the feet has subsided, and the animal walks<br>
fairly well, you should apply a blister containing Red Iodide of<br>
Mercury, two drams; Lard, two ounces, around the top of the hoofs, and<br>
rub in well twice forty-eight hours apart. In some cases of Founder it<br>
is recommended to bleed the animal in the foot. If this is attempted,<br>
good disinfectants should be used, as lock-jaw might follow.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
GALLS<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Injuries from ill-fitting collars, saddles, harness, hobbles and<br>
scalping-boots.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Remove the cause. Never wash a Gall with water, as this<br>
prevents its healing, nor use oils or salves, as they accumulate dirt,<br>
dust and germs, which may cause infection. The following application<br>
makes a very valuable dressing for Galls: Boracic Acid, one ounce; Corn<br>
Starch, one ounce; Tannic Acid, one-half ounce; Iodoform, one dram.<br>
Powder finely and place in sifter-top can. Dust on Gall before going to<br>
work and on retiring. This heals and refreshes the Galls and wounds by<br>
forming a smooth surface over the part, which permits it to heal while<br>
the horse works.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
GREASE HEEL<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Parasitic fungi invading cracked heels.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Offensive discharge from the glands under the skin, and if not<br>
properly treated, red spots will appear, and the yellow discharge will<br>
form a hard crust sticking to the roots of the hair.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Cleanliness is one of the most important measures. Also, good<br>
nourishing food. If the skin is swollen and tender, poultice with hot<br>
Flaxseed Meal or bran. After the swelling and tenderness have abated,<br>
wash well with good Castile Soap and Warm Water. Dry with clean cloth<br>
and apply the following mixture: Calomel, one dram; Iodoform, one dram;<br>
Boracic Acid, one ounce. Mix well and apply two to three times a day.<br>
Feed green grass, carrots, kale, apples, or potatoes if possible, also<br>
feed hot bran mashes. In all cases of Grease Heel give the following<br>
physic: Aloin, two drams; Pulv. Ginger, two drams. Place in a capsule<br>
and give with capsule gun. A physic has a very good effect on the blood,<br>
which assists materially in healing the cracks and nodules that appear<br>
in Grease Heel.<br>
<br>

BELGIAN STALLION BELVEDERE, FIRST PRIZE WINNER.<br>
Owned by Crawford &amp; Griffin, Newton, Iowa.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
GLANDERS OR FARCY<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Due to a specific germ called the Bacillus Malleii, or Bacillus<br>
of Glanders. Glanders, or Farcy, is very contagious, and is<br>
transmissible to man as well as animals. Cattle and sheep alone are<br>
immune. The disease may be contracted at watering troughs, stables,<br>
horseshoeing shops, in boats, trains and by harness, bits, curry combs,<br>
bedding, pails, etc., as well as by direct contact with a diseased<br>
animal.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Animal does not thrive although the appetite is good at times;<br>
loss of flesh, and is subject to sweats, the hair looks rough, the<br>
temperature increasing slightly, perhaps two degrees, a cough is<br>
generally present. Legs and abdomen are swollen; discharge from the<br>
nose, sometimes tinged with blood and very sticky, the membranes of the<br>
nose look dusty, and ulcers or spots are visible if closely examined.<br>
The glands under the back of the ears and between the jaws are hard,<br>
lumpy and swollen.<br>
<br>
In addition to the above symptoms, Farcy affects the skin by producing<br>
swellings, or nodules, varying from the size of a pea to that of a<br>
hickory nut (called Farcy buds, or Farcy buttons), which are found<br>
inside of the hind legs under the abdomen, on the side of the chest;<br>
shoulder and neck, also around the nose, lips and face. Generally there<br>
is a discharge of greenish-yellow pus, which is very sticky.<br>
<br>
Glanders, or Farcy, may be mistaken for nasal catarrh, nasal gleet,<br>
ulcerated teeth, nettle rash, lymphangitis, distemper, etc. Fortunately,<br>
this dreaded disease is not very prevalent in this country, as every<br>
precaution has been taken to stamp it out.<br>
<br>
NO TREATMENT: If at any time you have reason to think one of your<br>
animals has the disease, or even a neighbor's, or a transient horse,<br>
exhibits the symptoms, it is your duty to report the fact to the State<br>
Veterinarian at once. You will do this if you have your own welfare and<br>
that of your neighborhood at heart.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
HEAVES<br>
<br>
(Emphysema of the Lungs)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Fast or heavy work. It may follow Lung Fever or Pleurisy, or the<br>
animal may inherit weakness in the walls of the air-cells of the lungs.<br>
A very common cause is feeding dusty or dirty hay, or bulky food. Horses<br>
that are accustomed to eating ravenously are often victims of Heaves.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Disease may develop slowly or rapidly. When the animal is at<br>
rest, the air is taken into the lungs in a more or less normal manner,<br>
but is expelled by two distinct efforts, the abdominal muscles aiding<br>
the lungs in expiration, as may be seen by the heaving of the flank; the<br>
movement of the ribs in breathing is scarcely noticeable in a heavy<br>
horse. A healthy animal, when at rest, will throw the air from the lungs<br>
in a single effort. The difficulty in breathing is constant and<br>
increases in proportion to the amount of food in the stomach and<br>
intestines. At the beginning of the attack there is a spasmodic cough,<br>
which is more or less intermittent; this develops later into a short,<br>
weak, suppressed cough, as if the animal lacked strength in his chest to<br>
expel a full breath, often accompanied by expulsion of wind from the<br>
anus, which is somewhat protruded.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Feed good, nourishing food, but nothing that is of a bulky<br>
nature. Feed more grain and less hay, which should be dampened with<br>
water if dusty. Do not feed dusty, musty or bulky food, but give plenty<br>
of potatoes, apples, kale and green grass. Have your druggist make you<br>
up one quart of Fowler's Solution of Arsenic, omitting the Tincture of<br>
Lavender. This is soothing to the organs of breathing, and should be<br>
given two tablespoonfuls three times a day on the feed. After a week or<br>
ten days you might increase the dose slightly. Although this will make<br>
the horse work much better, do not give it with the hope of effecting a<br>
complete cure, as very few cases recover fully from this disease.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
HORSE DENTISTRY<br>
<br>
This is a very important branch of Veterinary Science, although, if I<br>
were to go into detail on the subject, it would require the writing of<br>
an individual volume. This science requires considerable practice. The<br>
price of special costly instruments would prohibit the average stockman<br>
from doing his own dentistry.<br>
<br>
My advice is to secure nothing but the services of a qualified<br>
Veterinarian, who has had privileges of a thorough knowledge of<br>
Veterinary Science.<br>
<br>
The art of animal dentistry has been abused by the owners of stock<br>
allowing the services of irresponsible men in the veterinary profession,<br>
who do not look to the betterment of the animal's condition. The owner<br>
of the animal, not being able to see the condition of the animal's teeth<br>
for himself, is persuaded into having the animal's teeth worked on<br>
regardless of whether it is needed or not. The quack or transient<br>
Veterinarian will pull and crack healthy, sound teeth, and also lacerate<br>
the poor animal's mouth. Be sure the Veterinarian employed for this<br>
purpose is competent.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
INFLUENZA<br>
<br>
(Pink Eye-Epizootic Catarrh)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Influenza is a specific and infectious fever, which shows a<br>
marked tendency to rapidly spread over a large area of country. It<br>
generally appears suddenly, without, preliminary symptoms, and may<br>
become fully developed in twenty-four hours.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: The usual symptoms are those of Catarrh, although the bowels,<br>
lungs and brain complications may be present, either singly or combined.<br>
It always gives rise to great weakness. The distinguishing<br>
characteristics of Influenza from Distemper, Sore Throat, and other<br>
diseases affecting the organs of breathing, are the suddenness of the<br>
attack, rise of temperature, varying from 103 to 106 degrees F., pulse<br>
feeble and fast, and a pinkish, swollen appearance of the inside of the<br>
eyelids. The animal is dull, in some cases almost unconscious. Sometimes<br>
the legs are very stiff and swollen, and there is great difficulty in<br>
moving about.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Place the affected animal in a clean, well ventilated stall,<br>
avoid drafts, give pure water to drink with chill taken off, in small<br>
quantities but often. Blanket if the weather is chilly, hand rub the<br>
legs and bandage, give Quinine, two drams, in a gelatin capsule with<br>
capsule gun every four hours. In addition to the above, administer the<br>
treatment recommended for Acute and Chronic Coughs.<br>
<br>
Feed good, nutritious food that has a laxative effect on the bowels, as<br>
it is dangerous to give horses physic with this disease. Hot bran<br>
mashes, steamed rolled oats and vegetables are very beneficial.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
LAMPAS<br>
<br>
CAUSE: In young horses it is commonly caused by cutting teeth. In older<br>
animals it is usually due to indigestion.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: A puffy swelling and redness of the gums. The animal may have<br>
difficulty in eating.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: In young animals, when cutting teeth, let nature take its<br>
course, but when an animal is five years or over, place two drams of<br>
Aloin, and two drams of Pulv. Ginger, in a gelatin capsule and<br>
administer with capsule gun. Then tone up the digestive organs by mixing<br>
one ounce of Pulv. Gentian Root, one ounce of Pulv. Nux Vomica, four<br>
ounces of Bicarbonate of Soda. Make into eight powders and give one<br>
powder in feed twice daily, or place in gelatin capsule and administer<br>
with capsule gun.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
LEECHES<br>
<br>
(Haemopis)<br>
<br>
The leeches which suck the blood of the horse may be divided into two<br>
classes, the external parasites which attach themselves to the skin of<br>
the legs and adjacent parts of the horse, and the Haemopis Sanguisuga,<br>
and others of this class, which, not being able to penetrate the skin,<br>
endeavor to enter the mouth or nostrils of the horse when he is drinking<br>
or grazing in wet and leech-infected pastures. They sometimes cling to<br>
the mucous membrane of the eyes. The horse leech, which lives in the<br>
water, usually gains access to the mouth and nostrils of the animal,<br>
when young and not more than one-tenth of an inch long. They rarely go<br>
beyond the air and food passages, generally fastening themselves to the<br>
walls of the windpipe and gullet, where they cling till the animal dies<br>
from loss of blood or suffocation. They often cause bleeding from the<br>
mouth and nostrils, and may be seen by close examination.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Endeavor to build up the condition of the animal with<br>
suitable food. Also feed liberal quantities of stock salt. Where the<br>
leeches cling tightly to the mucous membranes of the mouth and nostrils,<br>
it is well to cause the horse to inhale the vapor from hot water<br>
containing turpentine.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
LOCK-JAW<br>
<br>
(Tetanus)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: The bacilli of Tetanus are widely distributed and can be found in<br>
practically every part of the globe. Their favorite place of production,<br>
however, is in barn yards and marshy ground. They are frequently<br>
swallowed by stock along with forage, and can often be found in recently<br>
expelled feces. The most favorable temperature for their development is<br>
about 70 degrees F. They act by means of extremely virulent poisons<br>
which they produce, and which causes the terrible symptoms that are<br>
characteristic of the disease.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: The muscles of expression are usually the first brought under<br>
the continual spasm of tetanus, and when thus affected give the face of<br>
the animal a pinched and drawn-in appearance. The other muscles of the<br>
head and those of the neck are next attacked. The mouth is closed, the<br>
nose poked out, the head elevated. The muscles of breathing, and those<br>
of the limbs, become contracted so that the neck is hollowed, and the<br>
tail is raised, the horse stands with outstretched limbs. The animal<br>
shows great stiffness or rigidity in attempted movements. The eyes are<br>
sunken, and when startled or excited, the breathing is quickened and the<br>
flanks have a wrinkled or corrugated appearance. Death may quickly occur<br>
from continuous spasms of the muscles of the throat. Another sign is the<br>
flying up of the accessory eyelid when the animal is excited.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: If noticed in its first stages, and if the animal is able to<br>
eat, secure the services of an accomplished Veterinarian and insist on<br>
the use of fresh vaccine. This disease is almost impossible to cure, and<br>
about ninety per cent die.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
LUNG FEVER<br>
<br>
(Pneumonia)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Predisposition is largely accountable for this disease, which is<br>
more common to young horses than old; also, changes of temperature,<br>
introduction of foreign bodies or liquids into the trachea (windpipe)<br>
and the bronchial tubes, inhalation of smoke or irritating gases,<br>
excitement, exposure to cold after clipping, turning out to pasture from<br>
a warm stable, or injury to chest or ribs from being struck with a pole,<br>
etc.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Dullness in spirit; animal usually shivers or trembles; when<br>
this ceases the temperature rises to perhaps 103 to 106 degrees F.,<br>
pulse increases to sixty or ninety per minute, full and bounding;<br>
breathing short and labored and abnormally quick, increasing to perhaps<br>
fifty inspirations per minute, whereas in health it does not exceed<br>
twelve or thirteen per minute. A cough is also likely to be present, and<br>
the animals remain standing until they are on the road to recovery, or<br>
until death takes place. Other symptoms are constipation, feces covered<br>
with mucus or slime; urination frequent, scanty and dark in color;<br>
appetite poor, but thirst great; the eyes look glassy and the membranes<br>
have an inflamed appearance. It is a good sign if the animal looks about<br>
freely. When the critical stage is past the temperature and pulse<br>
gradually fall, the appetite returns and the urine becomes more<br>
abundant, and takes on its natural color, the cough loosens, and the<br>
discharge from the lungs is profuse, and of a yellowish color, and the<br>
breathing becomes normal.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Good care is of the utmost importance. Place the horse in a<br>
comfortable, well ventilated stall, being careful to exclude drafts.<br>
Hand rub and bandage the legs with woolen cloth. Blanket the animal,<br>
give plenty of bedding and keep pure water before him at all times.<br>
Internally administer Quinine, two ounces; Iodide of Ammonia, two<br>
ounces; Ammonia Bicarbonate, two ounces. Mix well and make into sixteen<br>
powders. Place powder in gelatin capsule and give with capsule gun every<br>
four hours. It is quite necessary that the above remedy should be placed<br>
in capsule, as drugs of this nature tend to irritate the throat. Do not<br>
give physics, as it is much safer to give laxative food, as hot bran<br>
mashes, steam rolled oats or some vegetables, in fact anything the<br>
animal will eat, i.e., that has food values. It is advisable to apply<br>
over the chest the following liniment; Aqua Ammonia Fort., four ounces;<br>
Turpentine, four ounces; Raw Linseed Oil, four ounces. Mix and shake<br>
well before applying each time over the chest cavity.<br>
<br>
In case the animal is constipated, give rectal injections of soap and<br>
warm water containing a few drops of Turpentine.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
MANGE<br>
<br>
(Scabies)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Mange is a contagious disease, produced by the presence of a<br>
small parasite that varies in length from a fiftieth to a hundredth of<br>
an inch, according to the species, of which there are three: Sarcoptes,<br>
which generally affects the withers; Symbiotes Communis, affecting the<br>
legs, and the Psoroptes Communis, which affects horses about the root of<br>
the tail and mane. The latter is the one most commonly found affecting<br>
horses. They multiply rapidly and are spread from diseased to healthy<br>
horses by their bodies coming in contact with one another, or by<br>
corrals, stables, railroad cars, etc., recently occupied by mangy<br>
horses.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: The mange mite attacks the skin and produces a thickness of<br>
its outer surface, covering it with crusts and scabs, with a consequent<br>
loss of hair. Intense itching accompanies the disease, and affected<br>
horses continually bite and rub themselves.<br>
<br>
Psoroptic Mange commences at the root of the tail, or at the roots of<br>
the mane on the neck or withers, and gradually spreads over the back, up<br>
to the head, over the sides, and finally affects the entire body. In<br>
cases of long standing the skin becomes ulcerated, the animal becomes<br>
greatly weakened, emaciated and finally dies.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: When a large number of horses are affected (in one locality)<br>
it is best to prepare a vat and dip them, under the supervision of the<br>
United States Bureau of Animal Industry. When just a few horses become<br>
affected, the following has proven very effective: Sulphur, eight<br>
ounces; Oil of Tar, eight ounces; Sweet Oil, two quarts. Mix and apply<br>
liberally to the parts affected. A few applications are generally<br>
sufficient to eradicate the disease.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
MONDAY MORNING DISEASE<br>
<br>
(Lymphangitis)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: This ailment is common with hard working horses, and is caused by<br>
confining them in the stable and allowing their usual amount of food.<br>
More nutriment is consumed than can be taken up by the system, which<br>
causes an irritation. It is frequently found in certain stables on<br>
Monday morning, hence its name--Monday Morning Disease.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Swelling and lameness, most usually affecting the hind leg<br>
inside of the thigh and extending down the leg in a hard ridge. It will<br>
pit on pressure, and cause intense pain; the horse will have difficulty<br>
in extending the limb forward, the swelling may surround the leg<br>
entirely. Pulse will be fifty to sixty per minute, temperature 102 to<br>
104 degrees F., breathing will be faster than normal. The animal has<br>
great thirst, but the appetite is very poor; usually remains standing;<br>
if he lies down will have great difficulty in getting up.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: In this particular disease apply hot fomentations to the<br>
affected limb or limbs, for one hour, then rub dry and apply Camphorated<br>
Liniment. Give Nitrate Potassi, Chlorate of Potassi, Iodide Potassi,<br>
each four ounces. Mix and make into thirty-two powders. Give one powder<br>
three times a day in drinking water or in a gelatin capsule and give<br>
with capsule gun.<br>
<br>
In most cases it is advisable to give a physic: Aloin, two drams; Pulv.<br>
Gentian Root, one dram; Ginger, one dram. Place in gelatin capsule and<br>
give with capsule gun.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
MUD FEVER<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Horses driven over muddy roads during the day and exposed to<br>
freezing weather at night, or driving them over muddy roads, then<br>
washing the limbs and not drying them properly, often produces a<br>
superficial inflammation of the legs.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: The legs are swollen, extremely hot and tender, the horse is<br>
stiff, the hair comes off the legs easily and if the cause is not<br>
removed severe complication may follow, as the secretions of the skin<br>
become greatly affected.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Prevention. Horses that are driven over muddy, wet roads<br>
should have their legs rubbed dry when stabling them for any length of<br>
time. When the legs are badly swollen wash them with clean warm water<br>
and Castile soap and dry them well with a clean soft cloth. Then apply<br>
Zinc Oxide Ointment or a lotion made from Acetate of Lead, one ounce;<br>
Zinc Sulphate, one-half ounce. Place in a quart of clean water and apply<br>
twice daily. Either application is very beneficial in the treatment of<br>
Mud Fever. Feed the animal wheat bran mashes, steamed rolled oats,<br>
vegetables, etc., as they have a very good effect on the system which<br>
aids in relieving the inflammation of the skin.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
NASAL GLEET<br>
<br>
(Chronic Catarrh)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Exposure to cold followed by neglect, and lack of nourishing<br>
food; bruise or fracture of the frontal bones of the head; injury of the<br>
blood-vessels inside the bones, or an ulcerated tooth. May also be<br>
caused by tumor, or foreign substance or liquids in the nasal cavities.<br>
Sometimes dried pus in the nostrils, resulting from a cold, will cause<br>
nasal gleet.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: A white or yellowish discharge from one or both of the<br>
nostrils, the quantity varying with the severity of the attack and the<br>
length of time the disease has been established. If, when tapping over<br>
the nose below the eye, a dull sound is produced, it is safe to conclude<br>
that the cavities are filled with pus; to make certain, compare the sick<br>
animal with a healthy one; in some cases you will notice that even the<br>
bones of the nose below the eye are slightly elevated. The lining of the<br>
nose may be of a red or yellow color but not ulcerated in spots, as in<br>
Glanders. The animal may continue in pretty good spirits and work well<br>
for a time but as the case develops he becomes lean in flesh and what is<br>
termed hide-bound. Always examine the teeth. In a case of long standing,<br>
the discharge has a fetid smell, differing in this respect also from<br>
Glanders.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: If not due to fractured bones of the head or ulcerated teeth,<br>
the animal will, in most cases, recover with proper medical treatment.<br>
When due to injury to the bones of the head, tumors, ulcerated teeth or<br>
dried pus in the nasal cavities, it is best to secure the services of a<br>
skillful Veterinarian, one whose professional knowledge renders him<br>
thoroughly competent. In the mild forms of nasal-gleet or chronic<br>
catarrh, administer the following: Ferri Sulphate, Potassi Iodide, Nux<br>
Vomica, each four ounces. Mix well and make into thirty-two capsules.<br>
Give one capsule three times daily and feed food that is nourishing and<br>
easily digested.<br>

<br>
NAVEL STRING INFECTION<br>
<br>
(Umbilical Pyemia)<br>
<br>
CAUSE AND NATURE: While the unborn foal (foetus) is in the womb of its<br>
mother, it is surrounded by enveloping membranes which constitute the<br>
after-birth on delivery. These membranes are attached to the wall of the<br>
womb and are connected to the foetus by means of the navel-string<br>
(umbilical cord) which is provided with two arteries and a vein for the<br>
nourishment of the young creature and for the removal of its waste<br>
products.<br>
<br>
It also has a narrow canal (the urachus) which serves to remove the<br>
urine of the foetus; in fact the subsequently formed bladder takes its<br>
origin from a dilation of the urachus. Under normal conditions when the<br>
foal is born, respiration takes place, the umbilical arteries and veins<br>
become quickly blocked up, urine is discharged through the urethra<br>
(which communicates with the penis or vagina, as the case may be), the<br>
foal enjoys a separate existence and the wound caused by the division of<br>
the umbilical cord leaves a scar which is known as the navel.<br>
<br>
It is usually supposed that the germ of navel-string infection gains<br>
admittance into the body through the exposed surface before the wound is<br>
closed. However, I am of the opinion that the mother is the bearer of<br>
the infection in a great many cases for in the uterine secretions of<br>
mares whose foals fell with navel-string infection, the same<br>
characteristic germs were found as were present in the joints of the<br>
affected foals. The infectious material is, by the act of covering,<br>
conveyed from mare to mare, so that the mucous membranes of the womb<br>
becomes the habitat of the specific germ. By inoculation of these germs<br>
into the blood stream of foals an illness is produced which in the<br>
smallest particular cannot be distinguished from that arising in<br>
naturally affected foals. It is a strange fact that when the infected<br>
germs are transmitted by the mother, their presence does not produce any<br>
disturbance in her.<br>
<br>
This is a very common malady in most places. I have known several<br>
instances on particular farms where they were unable to raise either<br>
foals or calves, but if the mother were removed to another farm<br>
immediately after or before foaling, the foal or calf lived and was<br>
reared without difficulty, and although constitutional debility plays an<br>
important part, the presence of specific germs constituting an infected<br>
area is, I believe, the most important factor in producing this disease.<br>
<br>
<br>
According to my observation, about seventy-five per cent of the cases<br>
die within the first three weeks after birth. This high rate of<br>
mortality would be considerably diminished if proper treatment was<br>
adopted.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: The attack usually comes on during the second or third week<br>
after birth and almost always before the closure of the navel opening,<br>
which, in affected animals, will be found to be in a wet and suppurating<br>
condition. Occasionally foals two or three months old which have the<br>
urachus closed and are in an apparently healthy condition contract this<br>
disease in a form of painful swelling of the joints. The first symptoms<br>
are generally dullness; more or less fever; lameness which is often<br>
attributed to rheumatism or to injury caused by the mare treading on the<br>
foal; the disinclination to move or even to stand. Upon examination the<br>
patient will be found to have a soft, gelatinous swelling of one or more<br>
of the joints of which the hock, elbow, fetlock, stifle and hip usually<br>
manifest the enlargement most clearly.<br>
<br>
These swellings are hot and painful to the touch; they tend to suppurate<br>
and frequently cause intense lameness. In very rare cases open urachus<br>
may exist without any joint inflammation. In this disease, inflammation<br>
of the joints and open urachus are almost always co-existent.<br>
<br>
Animals that recover from a bad attack are seldom worth the trouble of<br>
rearing, because as a rule their constitution becomes permanently<br>
impaired and one or more of their joints becomes stiffened by the<br>
attack.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: In the treatment of this disease, we have to attend to<br>
constitutional disturbances, inflamed joints, open urachus and<br>
complications such as constipation and diarrhoea. The comfort of our<br>
little patient must be studied under all circumstances. If the weather<br>
be at all cold it should be covered by a warm sheet. Should the foal<br>
have any difficulty in rising from the recumbent position, an attendant<br>
should assist it to rise and see that it is regularly fed. It is only in<br>
extreme cases that the animal refuses to suck its dam. During warm<br>
weather, and especially if the ground is dry, such a patient is always<br>
better off for a little sunshine, but on no account must it be left out<br>
during extreme heat, as in this state it is very liable to sunstroke.<br>
The best food for the mare is grass, which, during the day, she can<br>
generally have. The inflamed joints of the foal should be rubbed lightly<br>
with the following, after being thoroughly mixed: Red Iodide of Mercury,<br>
two drams; Vaseline, two ounces, every forty-eight hours, which, when<br>
applied to the skin, appears to have a well-marked antiseptic action on<br>
the underlying tissues. An inflamed joint should on no account be bathed<br>
with warm water, fomented or poulticed because the application of moist<br>
heat would be the best possible means for promoting the development of<br>
the infective germs which are the cause of the local and general<br>
disturbance. The open navel-string should not be ligatured because that<br>
operation is generally followed by an increased inflammation of the<br>
part, and by an aggravation of the other symptoms apparently on account<br>
of this outlet for deleterious products becoming blocked up. If the<br>
navel-string has been ligatured and is in an inflamed state, the<br>
ligature should be removed without delay. If the foal is constipated<br>
give two to three ounces of Castor Oil; also, administer the following:<br>
Zinc Sulphocarbolates, one-half dram; Hyposulphite of Soda, four ounces.<br>
Mix and make into thirty-two powders. Give one powder well back on the<br>
tongue every four hours.<br>
<br>
As a supplement to the food, we may give brown sugar or treacle, both of<br>
which are easily digested and are very nourishing. Four or five eggs<br>
daily will also aid in keeping up the strength.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
NAVEL RUPTURE<br>
<br>
(Umbilical Hernia)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Hereditary predisposition is well marked in this complaint. It<br>
may exist at birth, but so-called congenital rupture may very probably<br>
be the result of the pulling which the navel-string underwent at the<br>
time of foaling. However, umbilical hernia usually occurs during the<br>
first two or three months after birth; that is to say, while the opening<br>
at the navel is becoming obliterated and the tissues at that place are<br>
becoming consolidated. They can, however, appear later and may result<br>
from more or less violent strains sustained when the foals are jumping<br>
or playing. At other times these strains are induced by intestinal<br>
irritation accompanied by diarrhoea or constipation with straining. But,<br>
however the strain may take place, the abdominal muscles contract and<br>
push the intestines towards the wall of the belly. Then if they find an<br>
opening or even a weak spot, like the ring of the navel while it is<br>
undergoing the process of becoming blocked up, they select it and a<br>
rupture is produced.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: This rupture, the situation of which clearly shows its<br>
character, may vary in size from that of a hen's egg to that of an<br>
ostrich's egg. If pressed upon with the hand, especially if the animal<br>
is placed on its back, the rupture will disappear, to return, however,<br>
when the pressure is removed. If it be composed of intestines it will be<br>
soft and elastic when the bowels are empty, but when they are full of<br>
semi-solid food they will be doughy. In any event, the tumor will feel<br>
elastic when composed of intestines, but when formed of its connecting<br>
membranes, will naturally not vary in consistence. If intestines be<br>
present, movements and abdominal rumblings may be detected in it.&nbsp;
This<br>
rupture rarely gives rise to serious consequences because its contents<br>
are composed of large intestines and omentum, either of which is, in<br>
this position, not liable to become strangulated. It may, however,<br>
become engorged and inflamed from injury. Its existence naturally<br>
depreciates the value of an animal suffering from it.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: In the majority of cases, they will disappear with their own<br>
accord in two or three months. In case the rupture shows no signs of<br>
diminishing in size it is well to apply a bandage around the abdomen or<br>
secure the services of a competent veterinarian and he will prescribe a<br>
treatment or operate, which will apply directly to your colt's or<br>
horse's particular case.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
OPEN JOINT<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Injuries such as a kick from a sharp shoe, wire cuts, punctures<br>
from snags, or from probing a wound near a joint. Open joint is one of<br>
the most serious accidents that may happen to a horse, for the sufferer<br>
is apt to die from the ensuing constitutional disturbance, and even if<br>
he recovers the joint will, in all probability, be permanently stiff.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: If the joint is opened or severely injured the wound will have<br>
an ordinary appearance except that there may be a flow of joint oil from<br>
the injured oil sack. However, the discharge gradually becomes more<br>
unhealthy until finally it is mixed with pus and blood and assumes a<br>
fetid odor. After two or three days the joint swells and becomes very<br>
painful and a high fever sets in. In unfavorable cases the animal dies<br>
from exhaustion very shortly, or at best recovers with a permanently<br>
stiff joint.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Never probe a wound near a joint. If the injury is small and<br>
noticed immediately, apply Red Iodide of Mercury, two drams; Vaseline,<br>
two ounces. Mix and rub in well over the wound. This will set up<br>
sufficient inflammation to close the opening and kill any infection that<br>
may be present, as it possesses powerful antiseptic properties. If the<br>
wound is large, wash with Bichloride of Mercury, one part to one<br>
thousand parts distilled water. The wound should be washed twice a day<br>
with this solution. Then dust the wound with Tannic Acid, one ounce;<br>
Iodoform, one ounce; Boracic Acid, one ounce; Calomel, one dram. Mix and<br>
place in sifter top can and apply this after washing each time. Then<br>
bandage the wound by first placing clean absorbent cotton over the<br>
wound. Do not attempt to syringe a solution into an opening or some of<br>
the solution may gain entrance into the joint. Keep the animal as quiet<br>
as possible and feed laxative food.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
PALESADE WORM<br>
<br>
(Strongulus Armatus)<br>
<br>
This parasite thrives on marshy ground and is commonly found in the<br>
United States and Canada. The body of the worm is gray in color, more or<br>
less stiff and straight and thicker in the front than in the hind part;<br>
it varies in length, the male measuring from three-fourths of an inch to<br>
one inch and the female from one to two inches. It may occur in an adult<br>
or an immature state. In the former it implants itself on the mucous<br>
membrane of the large intestines by means of its armed mouth, while in<br>
the latter it lives in cysts underneath the mucous membrane of the<br>
intestines and is sometimes found in the brain, testicles and liver. The<br>
immature worms which do not issue directly from the cysts get into the<br>
arteries and are carried by the force of the blood to all parts of the<br>
body.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Same as in Red Worm with the exception of colicky pains caused<br>
by the worms blocking the arteries which carry blood to the intestines,<br>
thus interfering with the process of digestion. Where the worms enter<br>
the arteries of the limbs it results in lameness. It is a good plan to<br>
examine your animals once or twice a year to insure them against this<br>
pest.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Same as for Red Worm.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
PLEURISY<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Exposed to a sudden change of temperature, confinement in<br>
ill-ventilated, damp stables, wounds penetrating the chest, fractured<br>
ribs, heart diseases. It also occurs in conjunction with Bronchitis,<br>
Influenza, etc.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Generally only one side of the lungs is affected and that<br>
being the right, although it may affect both sides at the same time.<br>
First you will notice the animal distressed, uneasy, shivering, the<br>
affected side is painful to pressure of the hand. The breathing is short<br>
and quick, and the flanks heave--which shows that the animal tries to<br>
breathe as much as possible, by the action of the muscles of the abdomen<br>
and not by the movement of the ribs. The nostrils are dilated. There is<br>
usually a short, dry, painful cough present, which is repressed by the<br>
animal as much as possible, so as not to shake the inflamed parts. Often<br>
when expelling air from the lungs the horse gives a painful grunt<br>
especially when made to move. The pulse is generally hard and faster<br>
than usual. The temperature in early stages may rise from 104 to 106<br>
degrees F. If the ear is applied to the affected side a dry crackling or<br>
friction sound can be heard; a groove along the lower portion of the<br>
ribs will extend back to the flank. Within two or three days the pulse<br>
will be softer and weaker, temperature will fall to 101 or 102 degrees<br>
F. and there will be fluids form and the painful short breathing will<br>
disappear. The liquids may now undergo absorption if properly treated,<br>
and the case terminate favorably in a week or ten days.<br>
<br>
Frequently large quantities of fluid accumulate in the chest cavity that<br>
cannot be absorbed, the breathing becomes more difficult, short and<br>
quick, pulse becomes weak and rapid and the animal dies from exhaustion.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Place the animal in a comfortable, roomy stall; blanket if<br>
the weather is chilly, permit fresh air, but no drafts, as this is very<br>
important. Apply a paste made from Mustard and cold water over the chest<br>
cavity. Internally, administer Ammonium Iodide, Chlorate of Potash,<br>
Nitrate of Potash, each four ounces. Make into thirty-two powders and<br>
give one powder every two or three hours in gelatin capsule and<br>
administer with capsule gun. The diet is a proper means of keeping up<br>
the animal and is very important. Coax the animal to eat grass or<br>
vegetables, hot bran mashes or steam rolled oats. If there is a cough<br>
present, give the same treatment as recommended for Acute and Chronic<br>
Coughs.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
PIN WORM, THREAD OR MAW WORM<br>
<br>
(Oxyuris Curvilis)<br>
<br>
This worm when full grown is about one and three-quarter inches in<br>
length; its tail is thin and whip-like and head thick and terminating in<br>
a curve somewhat resembling the crook of a stick. The presence of these<br>
parasites may be detected by a light-yellow substance (the eggs of the<br>
worms) which adheres to the skin below the anus. Pin Worms like Round<br>
Worms frequently come away with the feces.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Dissolve four tablespoonfuls Common Salt in one gallon of<br>
warm water and inject it into the rectum. When this has been expelled,<br>
follow with an injection per rectum of Turpentine, four ounces, to<br>
one-half gallon Linseed Oil. Elevate the horse's hind quarters so as to<br>
retain the injection longer. This will expel the worms and their eggs<br>
that cling to the walls of the rectum. The worms sometimes make their<br>
way so far forward that it is impossible to reach them with an<br>
injection. In this case treat same as for Round worms.<br>
<br>
Where there is irritation produced about the tail the horse continually<br>
rubs and it is well to apply Mercurial Ointment to both tail and the<br>
anus.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
POLL EVIL<br>
<br>
Poll Evil is so-called because it occurs in the region of the poll. It<br>
is not a constitutional disease, but comes, no doubt, from well marked<br>
causes, as from inflammation set up and involving the bones and muscles<br>
in the region of the poll, and perhaps of the larger ligament. Owing to<br>
the low vitality of the parts and the action of the head in taking food,<br>
etc., the pus is apt to burrow deep into the muscles.<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Direct or indirect injury. A common cause is striking the head<br>
against a low doorway or an ill-fitting halter or bridle.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Swelling just back of the ears on one or both sides of the<br>
head. The animal stands with the nose out; slight heat in the parts,<br>
pain on pressure. In the first stages, it is merely inflammatory action.<br>
The second stage is suppuration, or there may be great swelling in some<br>
cases when there is but little pus formed.<br>
<br>
In other cases there is profuse suppuration and the pus makes its way<br>
out and discharges to the surface and sinuses are formed, which extend<br>
in various directions. Any abscess in this region is called Poll Evil.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: When the enlargement is first noticed in the region of the<br>
poll, I would advise the following: Red Iodide of Mercury, four drams;<br>
Lard, four ounces, rub in well over the enlargement and perhaps this<br>
will prevent sinuses from forming, but when the cases are long standing<br>
and so-called pipes are formed, I would advise that you secure the<br>
services of an accomplished Veterinarian.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
PETECHIAL FEVER<br>
<br>
(Purpura Haemorrhagica)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Constitutional weakness following some debilitating disease such<br>
as Distemper, Pink Eye, Catarrh and even following operations, when an<br>
animal becomes weak and from want of exercise, in which case it<br>
generally appears during his recovery. It is not infectious and cannot<br>
be transmitted by inoculations.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: There is a slight swelling of the limbs, more likely to be<br>
about the hocks. The swelling may disappear by exercising, but will soon<br>
return. The swellings present a very abrupt appearance, nearly the same<br>
as if a string were tied around the limbs and swell very quickly, and<br>
symptomatic of Purpura. Exudations take place in which, if on white<br>
limbs, you will see little red spots, from which a liquid is oozing. The<br>
swelling is very painful and the entire limb may be swollen. Small<br>
vesicles appear on the limbs and also in the mucous membranes, and it is<br>
well to look at the mucous membranes before giving your opinion, as you<br>
will, no doubt, detect these spots, which may extend into the lungs.<br>
These spots increase and may run into each other. The mucous membranes<br>
of the nose may become a mass of corrupt matter. The upper lip may hang<br>
pendulous, which is due to the want of nervous stimulus. If the nostrils<br>
are swollen very badly, there is difficulty in breathing and if the<br>
animal is not able to take food, the symptoms are considered very bad.<br>
The pulse varies much in some cases; although the swelling is very<br>
great, the pulse may not be more than forty or fifty per minute. The<br>
temperature is elevated one to three degrees above normal, there may be<br>
a coughing and a brownish colored discharge from the nostrils. The mouth<br>
and eyes become affected and, together with the discharge from the nose,<br>
the horse is a loathsome looking object. In milder cases the appetite is<br>
retained, or the animal may take food one day and the next refuse it.<br>
The bowels are constipated as a general thing in the first stages of the<br>
disease and the urine may be of a dark color, may even contain blood.<br>
There may be a peculiar dropsical swelling of these petechial spots or<br>
it may show itself in connection with the eyes and there may be blood<br>
extravasation without outer symptoms. This disease may affect the<br>
bowels, liver, lungs, etc. The animal usually stands, perhaps from the<br>
difficulty in moving the limbs. It is necessary to watch the case<br>
closely for flies will attack him and he will be filled with maggots.<br>
Sloughing may take place; the entire sheath or patches upon the body may<br>
slough off and there may be paralysis of the penis.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Place the animal in a clean, light, comfortable stall. If the<br>
weather is cold, blanket. The following medicine is recommended because<br>
of its particular effect on the blood in this disease: Chlorate of<br>
Potash, eight ounces; Iodide of Potash, eight ounces; Quinine Sulphate,<br>
eight ounces. Make into thirty-two capsules and give one capsule every<br>
six hours. Also administer one ounce capsules filled with Spirits of<br>
Turpentine three or four times a day. Moisten the capsules with Sweet<br>
Oil and give with capsule gun. Feed hot bran mashes containing two or<br>
three ounces of pure Flaxseed meal. Also, feed vegetables, green grass,<br>
if possible.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
QUITTOR<br>
<br>
(Fistula of the Foot)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Injuries. Horses working on rough stony roads are subject to<br>
punctures, pricks, bruises, corns, treads, etc., which end in pus<br>
formation which does not get a pendant opening and destroys the tissues<br>
with which it comes in contact. Finally it bursts, forms sinuses and<br>
pipes, as commonly called, at the top of the hoof.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Extreme lameness, heat, pain and swelling will show themselves<br>
about the top of the hoof. As a rule a Quittor develops slowly and is<br>
more or less painful during the first stages. After the sinus is formed<br>
and the pus discharges, the inflammation generally subsides. Its healing<br>
process is often delayed due to the diseased portion of the cartilages<br>
inside the horny hoof.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Apply Flaxseed or hot Bran poultices to relieve the<br>
inflammation and hasten the formation of sinuses or pipes. Then with an<br>
ordinary syringe inject the following: Silver Nitrate, ten grains;<br>
Water, one ounce. Inject fifteen to twenty drops twice daily.&nbsp;
Keep the<br>
food clean and the animal as quiet as possible. It is very disagreeable,<br>
as stated before, and the healing is very slow, but this must be<br>
naturally expected, as we are unable to provide the sinuses with good<br>
drainage.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
RED WORM<br>
<br>
(Strongylus Tetracanthus)<br>
<br>
The Red Worm varies in length from one-third to three and one-quarter<br>
inches, and is sometimes white though it usually appears to be red<br>
because of the blood it contains. This parasite is found in all parts of<br>
the world. Its favorite haunt is marshy land.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Paleness of all visible membranes, eyes watery and inflamed,<br>
swelling of the sheath, legs, and lower surface of the belly; fetid<br>
diarrhoea, dullness, debility, emaciation, rough coat, and the presence<br>
of worms in the feces. The worms when first passed are bright red in<br>
color but after being exposed to the air they turn dark and may easily<br>
escape the notice of the casual observer.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Withhold all food for twenty-four hours, then place the<br>
following drugs in a gelatin capsule: Calomel, two drams, Barbadoes<br>
Aloes, three drams; Ferri Sulphate, two drams. Give with capsule gun.<br>
Also place the following tonic in their feed: Pulv. Quassia, one ounce;<br>
Ferri Sulphate, two ounces; Pulv. Anise Seed, two ounces. Mix and make<br>
sixteen powders. Give one powder two or three times a day in the feed.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
RHEUMATISM<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Exposure to cold rains, drafts, lying on damp ground when the<br>
blood is in poor condition. Also due to over-stimulating food.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Lameness, swelling or soreness which may shift from one place<br>
to another, then finally locate in or near one of the joints of the<br>
limbs.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Take away all grains and feed laxative foods such as<br>
potatoes, carrots, apples, kale and good hay. If the weather is warm<br>
turn out to pasture, but confine in warm stable at night. It is<br>
advisable to give a physic, as Aloin, two drams; Gentian, one dram;<br>
Ginger, one dram. Place in gelatin capsule and give at one dose with<br>
capsule gun, as its action on the blood has a very good effect. When the<br>
swellings are painful, apply Camphorated Liniment once or twice daily.<br>
Also, administer the following tonic: Potassi Iodide, one ounce; Nitrate<br>
of Potash, two ounces; Chlorate of Potash, two ounces; Pulv. Gentian<br>
Root, one ounce; Ferri Sulphate, one ounce; Pulv. Anise Seed, four<br>
ounces. Mix well and make into twenty powders. Give one powder three<br>
times a day in bran or place in capsule and give with capsule gun.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
RING BONE<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Faulty conformation--as a narrow or straight pastern joint is<br>
considered faulty. Be very careful in selecting a sire when breeding, as<br>
faulty conformation is hereditary. Ringbone may also result when young<br>
animals are put to work on hard roads or running in stony pastures<br>
sometimes produces Ringbone before the bones have become properly<br>
hardened. Other causes are injury to tendons or ligaments, bruised<br>
joints, blows, calking, or picking up a nail.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Lameness will manifest itself when the horse first starts out<br>
in the morning; this may become less noticeable or even disappear<br>
temporarily as the animal works. They gradually grow lamer and<br>
examination will disclose an enlargement at or around the top of the<br>
hoof. This may appear in one or more feet, but the front feet are more<br>
often affected.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: If the Ringbone is very much inflamed, reduce the heat by<br>
applying cold water or ice packs to the part. Clip off all hair from<br>
around the top of the hoof and rub in well for twenty minutes the<br>
following: Red Iodide of Mercury, two drams; Pulv. Cantharides, two<br>
drams; Turpentine, one dram; Pine Tar, two drams, and mix in two ounces<br>
of Lard. This applied every two days for a week and repeat same<br>
treatment in two weeks. Keep the animal as quiet as possible as it<br>
assists in producing a recovery. If the animal is comparatively young,<br>
recovery is certain, although the enlargement may never disappear.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
ROUND WORM<br>
<br>
(Ascaris Megalcephala)<br>
<br>
Resembles the Earth Worm somewhat in shape, yellowish-white in color,<br>
stiff and elastic. When full grown, it varies in length from six to<br>
sixteen inches. These worms are usually found in the small intestines,<br>
although they sometimes invade the stomach, and when numerous seriously<br>
disturb the animal's health.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: The animal's general health is affected as is evident from the<br>
morbid state of his appetite, rough coat, pot-belly, liability to colic<br>
and slight diarrhoea. Some of these worms are often expelled with the<br>
feces. As they increase in number, they block up the small intestines,<br>
giving rise to colic, and may in time kill the horse. They sometimes<br>
cause perforation of the bowels.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Withhold all food from eighteen to twenty-four hours, then<br>
administer the following: Ferri Sulphate, two drams; Antimony Tartrate,<br>
two drams; Pulv. Quassia, two drams. Place in gelatin capsule and give<br>
with capsule gun. Follow this from six to eight hours with Aloin, two<br>
drams; Ginger, two drams, and give as above directed. It is a good plan<br>
to repeat the above treatment in ten days to insure the removal of any<br>
worms which may have survived the first treatment.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
SCROTAL RUPTURE<br>
<br>
(Inguinal Hernia)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Abnormal size of the upper ring through which a part of the<br>
intestines or its connecting membrane descends into and through the<br>
canal leading from the abdomen to the scrotal cavity. There is little<br>
danger of strangulation from this form of rupture which may occur at<br>
birth and disappear with age. A careful examination should therefore be<br>
made of the scrotum before castration.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: In most cases, this condition is easily detected. The scrotum<br>
will be somewhat enlarged. Sometimes the intestines will become<br>
strangulated and colicky symptoms appear. When a young male colt shows<br>
signs of colic, examine him for Scrotal Rupture.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: The trouble usually disappears with age although in some<br>
cases it is well to operate. Where colicky symptoms are present, roll<br>
the colt on its back, manipulating the scrotum. Diet carefully.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
SHOE BOIL<br>
<br>
(Capped Elbow)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Injuries, bruises or pressure when lying on a rough floor. Sharp<br>
heeled shoes and kicks also have a tendency to produce it.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: A hot painful swelling of the Elbow joint when first noticed.<br>
When neglected, it takes on a white fibrous or callous growth.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: First remove the cause. Do not lance the enlargement; let it<br>
come to a head of its own accord, by applying Red Iodide of Mercury, two<br>
drams; Pulv. Cantharides, three drams; Lard, two ounces. Mix well<br>
together and apply twice a week. When the swelling is hot and painful it<br>
is well to apply cold water or ice packs before applying the above<br>
mentioned prescription.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
SPLINTS<br>
<br>
CAUSE: This disease is chiefly produced by trotting or running on hard<br>
ground, etc. It is evident that horses with high knee action and heavy<br>
bodies are more liable to this disease. Jumping is also a common cause<br>
of splints, but the more accustomed a horse is to jumping the less<br>
liable he is to throw splints, because practice teaches the animal to<br>
regulate his movements so as to more or less diminish the disagreeable<br>
if not actually painful effect of concussion.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: A splint is detected by grasping the horse's leg with the<br>
fingers upon one side and the thumb upon the other, and tracing the<br>
inner and outer splint bones from their heads downward to their tapering<br>
extremities. Any actual enlargement will at once arrest the hand; any<br>
rising or irregularity will create suspicion and lead to close<br>
examination. Horses, especially young ones which have lately been put to<br>
work, not infrequently develop splints before any swelling appears. For<br>
this reason, in examining a case of obscure lameness, particularly if<br>
the animal is young, do not fail to look for the sign of splint<br>
lameness, namely: that the lameness is abnormally greater at a trot than<br>
at a walk and that the animal usually fails to bend the knees freely and<br>
grows worse with exercise. The last mentioned condition is also present<br>
with corns, but an examination of the foot will determine the question<br>
of their existence. In young horses splints are sometimes mistaken for<br>
coffin-joint lameness or navicular disease. To avoid this error, it<br>
should be remembered that, when brought on by navicular disease, the<br>
action of the limb improves with exercise; also that horses of five<br>
years of age or less very rarely suffer from coffin-joint disease. Some<br>
horses, owing to unusual development of the inner splint bones of the<br>
fore legs may appear to have splints, although careful examination may<br>
prove both limbs to be free from any bony deposit. When deciding such a<br>
point, note if the two inner splint bones are of the same size. Any<br>
swelling perceptible in a limb recently affected with splint-lameness is<br>
usually attended by heat and pain.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: If there is heat present, foment with hot or cold water; when<br>
heat has subsided, apply the following ointment: Red Iodide of Mercury,<br>
two drams; Turpentine, twenty drops, and mix. Apply every forty-eight<br>
hours until three applications have been applied. Rub in for twenty<br>
minutes each time.<br>
<br>
During this treatment use the horse for slow work on soft roads, etc. As<br>
a rule the splints will not disappear at once, but will gradually. I may<br>
add that common splints are not considered an unsoundness.<br>

<br>
SPASMODIC COLIC<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Horses seem to be predisposed to this form of colic on account of<br>
the great length of their intestines which are apt to be telescoped,<br>
twisted or their circular muscular fibers spasmodically contracted.<br>
Perhaps the principal cause is a change of food, sudden change of<br>
temperature, constipation, drinking cold or too large a quantity of<br>
water, especially if the animal is warm; overloading the stomach with<br>
frozen or mouldy food. Worms frequently produce colic.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: If the animal is tied it will become uneasy, paw, point its<br>
nose to the flank, twitch the tail, lie down and get up frequently. If<br>
the animal is loose it will walk around, paw, kick at its belly with the<br>
hind feet, make attempts to lie down, roll on its back and remain in<br>
that position for a while. The pulse increases with the pain,<br>
temperature rises from one-half to one degree, breathing labored and<br>
fast, the animal sweats in spots, there may be diarrhoea present, but<br>
this does not frequently occur.<br>
<br>
Unfavorable symptoms of spasmodic colic are cold legs to the feet, point<br>
of the ears cold, trembling of the muscles, cold sweats, mucous<br>
membranes of the nose, mouth and eyes have a dark color due to the<br>
congestion.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: In all cases of spasmodic colic, except where there is<br>
diarrhoea present or mares heavily in foal, give Aloin, two drams;<br>
Ginger, two drams. Place in gelatin capsule and give with capsule gun.<br>
It is advisable to give rectal injection of Warm Water and Glycerine.<br>
They are soothing and cooling to the intestinal canal. Also give the<br>
following prescription: Pulv. Nux Vomica, four ounces; Carbonate of<br>
Ammonia, four ounces; Asafoetida, four ounces. Make into six powders;<br>
place one powder in gelatin capsule and give with capsule gun every two<br>
hours until relieved. The former prescription removes the cause as it is<br>
a physic. The latter contains medicines blended so as to counteract the<br>
spasmodic contractions of the bowels. It is also a heart stimulant, just<br>
what is needed in colic to keep up the animal's vitality. Beware of<br>
colic remedies that are given in drop doses. They contain drugs to only<br>
relieve the pain and not remove the cause. When their effects are worn<br>
off, the disease has progressed; the animal's heart action has been<br>
weakened and chances are that the animal will die. If drenching is<br>
resorted to, it must be done with great precaution. Remember a horse<br>
cannot breathe through his mouth.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
SIDE BONES<br>
<br>
CAUSE: The chief causes of Side Bones are: Deprivation of frog pressure,<br>
injuries, high heeled shoes, the use of which is almost entirely<br>
confined to draft horses. A high-heeled shoe prevents the frog from<br>
resting on the ground which is its natural support.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Enlargement just above the hoof, usually affecting the front<br>
feet, or may affect only one side of one of the feet. The pain which<br>
produces the lameness is due to pressure on the soft tissues between the<br>
newly formed side bone and the hoof. Sometimes the enlargement has a<br>
tendency to spread the hoof. In such a case the lameness is not so<br>
severe.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Clip the hair from over the Side Bone and rasp the foot below<br>
the enlargement, so that the hoof will be flexible on pressure from the<br>
fingers. Then apply the following to both the enlargement and the rasped<br>
surface on the hoof: Red Iodide of Mercury, two drams; Pulv.<br>
Cantharides, four drams. Mix well in two ounces of Lard and apply every<br>
forty-eight hours until three applications have been applied.<br>
<br>
If you must work the animal, put it to some easy work where it has soft<br>
ground to walk upon.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
STAGGERS<br>
<br>
(Forage Poisoning--Inflammation of the Brain)<br>
<br>
(Cerebral Meningitis)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Certain plants or stagnant water are most commonly instrumental<br>
in producing staggers; frequently seen in the early autumn months when<br>
the grass in the pastures becomes dry and certain forage remains green<br>
which contains toxic principles. These plants are ravenously eaten by<br>
horses on account of being green and tender. This is one of the common<br>
causes of the disease, although mouldy, indigestible or highly<br>
nitrogenous foods are frequently producers of staggers. This form of<br>
staggers is not contagious, although what produces staggers in one horse<br>
will also produce it in another. In this way several horses may become<br>
affected with staggers at the same time. Inflammation of the brain may<br>
occur as a complication of some infectious or digestive disease. Other<br>
causes are blows to the head, tumors in or on the brain, which cause the<br>
animal to naturally stagger, as the brain controls the horse's organs of<br>
locomotion.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Vary to a certain extent, but a careful observer will detect<br>
some trouble connected with the nervous system, as the animal walking<br>
unsteadily, stepping high and keeping the legs spread apart, bracing<br>
itself to keep from falling. There is also great depression, as dullness<br>
and sleepiness with little or no inclination to move about. The head may<br>
be placed against a wall or fence and the legs kept moving as if the<br>
horse were trying to walk. As the disease progresses and no attempts are<br>
made to relieve it, they will become fractious, nervous, easily excited,<br>
pawing and eventually fall, keeping the feet moving as if walking,<br>
throwing their heads about in a delirious manner and eventually death<br>
follows. The horse as a rule eats and drinks ravenously when the first<br>
signs of staggers are noticed, but in its latter stages the tongue and<br>
gullet become paralyzed and although the animal attempts to eat and<br>
drink he cannot swallow. The pulse varies. It is strong, but subnormal<br>
when the first symptoms of staggers are noticed, that is to say, it is<br>
as slow as twenty to twenty-five beats per minute. As the disease<br>
progresses, however, it becomes weaker and faster. Constipation<br>
frequently accompanies this disease, also paleness tinged with yellow<br>
about the mucous membranes of the mouth and eyes. In many instances I<br>
believe that the poisonous forage eaten by horses depresses the heart<br>
action to such an extent that it results in the brain not receiving the<br>
proper blood supply, causing dizziness or staggers.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Place the animal in a clean, dark stall, keeping the<br>
surroundings as quiet as possible. In its first stages it is easily<br>
treated, but as the horse becomes easily excited and his swallowing<br>
becomes difficult, treatment becomes more difficult. When the first<br>
signs are noticed, administer a physic as: Aloin, two or three drams;<br>
Ginger, two or three drams, according to the size of the animal. Place<br>
in gelatin capsule and give with capsule gun. This physic removes the<br>
irritant from the intestines and prevents its absorption into the blood.<br>
Also administer the following: Bromide of Potassium, twelve ounces;<br>
Nitrate of Potash, four ounces; Iodide of Potash, three ounces. Make<br>
into twenty-four capsules and give one capsule every four hours.<br>
<br>
My method of administering medicine to animals places me in a position<br>
to treat them and compel them to take the medicine even though paralysis<br>
may exist. When animals will eat, feed food that is easily digested, as<br>
hot wheat bran mashes, steamed rolled oats and vegetables and give small<br>
quantities, but often, of clean fresh water. It is necessary to give<br>
stimulants and tonics as soon as they are on the road to recovery, as<br>
Pulv. Nux Vomica, four ounces; Pulv. Gentian Root, four ounces; Sulphate<br>
of Iron, two ounces. Make into sixteen capsules and give one capsule<br>
three times daily.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
STIFLE JOINT LAMENESS<br>
<br>
(Dislocation of the Patella)<br>
<br>
Although dislocations are infrequent, this is the most common form which<br>
occurs in the horse.<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Young loose jointed horses are predisposed to dislocation of the<br>
stifle on account of the comparative want of strength of their<br>
ligaments. They are much more liable to this accident than older horses,<br>
especially if they are in poor health or in rough hilly pastures; the<br>
nature of which would naturally make them susceptible to this injury,<br>
which, however, may take place as a result of accident at any age. Young<br>
horses that suffer, off and on from dislocation, often lose their<br>
liability with increasing strength and age. This dislocation may be<br>
partial or complete. In the former instance and the most common is where<br>
the patella, or the little stifle bone that glides in the groove<br>
composed of the lower hip and upper thigh bones, has become partially<br>
dislocated or removed from its natural position.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: When the dislocation is complete the affected limb is drawn<br>
forward, while the foot from the pastern down is drawn backward, and the<br>
animal may throw weight on it when made to move, which is accomplished<br>
with great difficulty. When the dislocation is partial, the symptoms are<br>
about the same as mentioned, only the limb is less rigid. If the horse<br>
is moved, the stifle makes a klick sound. In this form, you may have<br>
both limbs affected.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: In partial dislocation, the stifle bone may be replaced by<br>
drawing the leg forward, and with the hand pressing in on the stifle. In<br>
complete dislocation, tie a rope around the pastern of the affected leg,<br>
then draw the rope through a collar placed around the horse's neck and<br>
draw forward as far as possible and tie. Then press with both hands<br>
inward. After the stifle is placed back into position use the following<br>
liniment: Aqua Ammonia Fort., four ounces; Oil of Turpentine, four<br>
ounces; Raw Linseed Oil, four ounces. Mix and apply well over the stifle<br>
joint once or twice a day for two or three days. Feed nourishing food<br>
and put the animal to slow, easy work or turn out to good pasture.<br>
<br>
In old chronic cases of Stifle Joint Lameness, treatment is of no value,<br>
therefore, care for the animal as soon as the catch in the walk or<br>
lameness appears.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
STRING-HALT<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Several theories have been put forth as to the cause of<br>
String-Halt which is generally supposed to be a nervous disease; a<br>
condition opposite to paralysis. The exact cause of this disease is hard<br>
to determine, but it is likely to occur in highly nervous horses. It<br>
sometimes follows an injury which may have irritated the nerves in some<br>
way. I believe that castration causes it in many instances, due to the<br>
severe struggle when being thrown, or pulling down severely on the<br>
spermatic cord when removing the testicle.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Spasmodic contraction of one or both limbs. This sign varies,<br>
as sometimes it is very violent, while in others it may be so slight<br>
that it is hard to detect when stepping the horse forward, but on<br>
backing or turning the horse around the signs are easily noticed. All<br>
symptoms are better marked in the winter than in the summer, as some<br>
show it in the winter that do not show it in the summer at all.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Very unsuccessful, although an operation proves beneficial in<br>
some cases, but if this is attempted, the services of a competent<br>
Veterinarian should be secured.<br>
<br>
The feeding of laxative foods that are easily digested relieves<br>
String-Halt in many instances.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
SORE THROAT<br>
<br>
(Pharyngitis--Laryngitis)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Exposure to cold weather or rain when the animal is not<br>
accustomed to it; drenching with irritating medicines or inhaling<br>
irritating smoke or gases.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: At first the animal generally chills, the legs and ears are<br>
cold, but eventually they become very warm as the temperature increases,<br>
coughing, grinding of the teeth, saliva oozing from the mouth; the<br>
animal will hold its head in a stiff straight position, moving it as<br>
little as possible. There will be great difficulty in masticating and<br>
swallowing, as the food will come from the mouth in the form of wads,<br>
and as this soreness of the throat progresses food will also come from<br>
the nostrils. This is a bad sign, as extensive inflammation is no doubt<br>
present. Water, also, runs through the nostrils freely when the animal<br>
attempts to drink, due to the swollen condition of the throat. The<br>
animal forces the water back into the mouth, but is unable to swallow<br>
and hence the water gushes out through the nostrils. The animal evinces<br>
great pain when pressure is applied from the outside and he breathes<br>
with great difficulty. Although the pulse is not much affected at this<br>
stage, the temperature is elevated from one to two degrees above normal.<br>
The urine becomes scanty and highly colored, the eyes bloodshot and<br>
discharging. Eventually the throat becomes greatly swollen and abscesses<br>
may form and discharge. As a rule constipation is associated with this<br>
disease.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Mild attacks of sore throat are easily treated, but when<br>
serious cases develop, it is unsuccessful. Place the animal in a clean,<br>
comfortable stall; permit as much fresh air as possible, but avoid all<br>
drafts. If the weather is chilly, blanket the animal, hand rub the legs<br>
and bandage with woolen cloths or bandage. Administer a mixture made<br>
from Chlorate of Potash, three ounces; Nitrate of Potash, three ounces;<br>
Tannic Acid, one-half ounce; Molasses, one-half pint; Pine Tar, one-half<br>
pint. Mix well and place about one tablespoonful on the tongue every two<br>
hours in severe cases; in mild attacks, give less frequently. When they<br>
will eat, feed food that is easily digested, as hot wheat bran mashes<br>
and steamed rolled oats containing two or three ounces of pure ground<br>
flaxseed. It is always necessary to apply strong liniments to the<br>
throat, as they relieve inflammation and stimulate the formation of an<br>
abscess. The following liniment will be found very beneficial: Aqua<br>
Ammonia Fort., four ounces; Oil of Turpentine, four ounces; Sweet Oil,<br>
six ounces; shake well and apply two or three times daily. If the<br>
swelling is extreme between the jaws, so as to interfere with the<br>
animal's breathing, it is well to lance the abscess if a soft spot can<br>
be found. Just cut through the skin with a knife; then use a clean blunt<br>
instrument to locate the pus cavity. Otherwise, severe hemorrhage may be<br>
produced.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
SURFEIT<br>
<br>
(Nettle-Rash--Urtecaria)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: The usual cause of Surfeit is supposed to be due to a character<br>
of food consumed which upsets the animal's digestive organs, the skin<br>
being continuous with the mucous membranes lining the intestinal canal.<br>
A disturbance of the one structure is readily communicated to the other.<br>
Apparently, owing to the extreme dry nature of the forage during the<br>
greater part of the year, horses in the United States frequently suffer<br>
from Surfeit.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Surfeit is a term applied to an eruption of small irregular<br>
lumps or boils which are more or less painful to the touch and which<br>
break out suddenly as a rule on the horse's body and neck, and in rare<br>
cases on the legs. A favorite seat of Surfeit is the parts covered with<br>
the harness or saddle and along the neck and withers. Surfeit is very<br>
troublesome and annoys both the horse and driver, especially when the<br>
horse perspires, as he will rub violently when coming in contact with<br>
any object.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Give two to four ounces of Epsom Salts in hot wheat bran<br>
mashes every morning. Feed as much sloppy food as possible, vegetables,<br>
etc. Avoid feeding dry woody hay, as it irritates the intestines and<br>
aggravates the disease.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
SWEENEY<br>
<br>
(Atrophy)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: An ill fitting collar, one tug longer than the other, striking an<br>
object when pulling, like a stone or a corner of a building, slipping,<br>
kicks, or the animal may have a splint, sprain, ringbone, side bone,<br>
coffin-joint lameness, curb, corns, stifle lameness, in fact anything<br>
that tends to make an animal favor the use of certain muscles. It is not<br>
a disease, just a lack in the development of the muscles, which waste<br>
away or shrink when not used as nature provided. For instance, perhaps<br>
you have had or have seen persons that had a fractured leg or arm and on<br>
account of not being able to use the leg or arm the muscles wasted away<br>
(Atrophy), until they were used normally for sometime, when the muscles<br>
again came back to their normal size.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: First locate the cause. The animal may be very lame although I<br>
have seen Sweeneys where lameness was very hard to detect, being those<br>
which were usually due to ill fitting collars. Remember you can have a<br>
Sweeney of the hip as well as the shoulder, and keep in mind the above<br>
mentioned causes.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: When you have an animal affected with Sweeney, find the true<br>
cause and remove it if possible. Unless the Sweeney is an old chronic<br>
one, it is successfully treated with Aqua Ammonia Fort., four ounces;<br>
Turpentine, four ounces; Sweet Oil, four ounces. Mix and apply well over<br>
wasted muscles once a day. If the application is too irritating, as some<br>
horses have thinner skins than others, it is advisable to add more Sweet<br>
Oil than above mentioned.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
TAPEWORM<br>
<br>
(Taenia)<br>
<br>
These worms have been found in the horse, but so rarely that they need<br>
not be considered.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
THOROUGHPIN<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Generally due to some irritation of the hock joint such as severe<br>
sprains from animal jumping, slipping, kick or falling through a culvert<br>
or bridge or it is frequently hereditary; so be very careful in choosing<br>
a sire when breeding.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Sometimes there is lameness when the Thoroughpin is first<br>
noticed, but it will gradually disappear as soon as the inflammation<br>
ceases. There will be a puffy, soft enlargement which occurs at the<br>
upper and back part of the hock, beneath the great tendons. Generally<br>
both sides are enlarged and puffy, but occasionally it happens that one<br>
side is only involved. Thoroughpin is also a forerunner of Bog Spavin as<br>
they generally are connected, as you are aware that the hock contains<br>
joint oil as all other joints do, retained in place by a thin, white<br>
fibrous membrane. Irritation of the hock joint tends to develop an extra<br>
large quantity of joint oil, and the hock is less protected by tendons<br>
where a Thoroughpin or Bog Spavin occurs--hence those puffy swellings<br>
are filled with joint oil and are connected. If you press on one side of<br>
a Thoroughpin, you will see the other side bulge out. If you press on a<br>
Bog Spavin and there is a Thoroughpin present, you will see it bulge on<br>
either side of the Thoroughpin--or vice versa.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: If on an old horse and the Thoroughpin is of long standing,<br>
treatment is unsatisfactory, but on the other hand if the animal is<br>
young it can be successfully treated with Tincture of Iodine, one ounce;<br>
Gum Camphor, two ounces; Gasolene, one pint. Mix well and rub in with<br>
nail or tooth brush twice a week. Keep the animal as quiet as possible<br>
as the results will be accomplished much sooner. Never attempt to open<br>
or lance a puffy swelling about a joint as it contains joint oil. The<br>
result would be an open joint.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
THRUSH<br>
<br>
CAUSE: The two main causes of Thrush are lack of pressure on the frog<br>
and the decomposing effect of filth and fermentation of organic matter<br>
which accumulates in the cleft of the frog.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: The animal in some cases is lame; there will be a swelling<br>
accompanied by a very fetid discharge; in some cases the frog has<br>
practically rotted away; there will be more or less inflammation in the<br>
foot. The legs may even swell. Thrush is more frequently found in the<br>
hind feet because of the manure and filth with which they must come in<br>
contact.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Cut away all loose pieces of horn from over the frog and<br>
apply a Flaxseed meal poultice and leave it on for twenty-four hours,<br>
after which wash well with Soap and warm water. Then apply Calomel to<br>
the groove in the frog. Keep the foot clean. Do not allow the animal to<br>
stand in filth.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
WIND COLIC<br>
<br>
(Flatulent Colic)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: This dangerous form of Colic is a distension of the bowels with<br>
gas, resulting generally from the decomposition of undigested food in<br>
the bowels. It sometimes follows Spasmodic Colic, in which there is<br>
first spasms due to the irritations set up by the presence of undigested<br>
matter, and subsequently this food decomposes and forms gas. I may<br>
conclude that Flatulent or Wind Colic is usually caused by errors in<br>
feeding and watering horses. Perhaps the animal has been given large<br>
quantities of rank grass, watery roots, which on account of its moist<br>
nature is quickly swallowed without being properly masticated.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: The signs resemble those of Spasmodic Colic, except that they<br>
are less violent. In most cases there is general accumulation of gas,<br>
the abdomen distended to a considerable size before the animal shows<br>
signs of uneasiness. In cases where the animal swells on the right side,<br>
it is the large intestines filled with gas. In other cases where both<br>
sides are equally swollen, the stomach and small intestines contain gas.<br>
The horse's back will have an arched appearance, passing of gas from the<br>
anus frequently, the horse will make attempts to vomit. In some cases<br>
actual vomiting takes place. This is a bad sign, as rupture of the<br>
stomach usually occurs at this stage.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Give Aloin, two drams; Ginger, two drams, in gelatin capsule<br>
and give with capsule gun. However, this is a physic and should not be<br>
given to mares heavily in foal. Also apply to the abdominal cavity,<br>
liniment consisting of Aqua Ammonia Fort., four ounces; Oil of<br>
Turpentine, four ounces; Sweet Oil, four ounces. Mix and rub in well<br>
over the abdomen.<br>
<br>
To mares heavy with foal, apply the above liniment and give rectal<br>
injections of Glycerine and warm water frequently.<br>
<br>
The following remedy should be administered to all cases of Colic,<br>
including mares heavy with foal: Aromatic Spirits of Ammonia, six<br>
ounces; Turpentine, six ounces. Mix well together and place one ounce in<br>
gelatin capsule and give with capsule gun every hour. Puncturing the<br>
intestines is advisable in some cases to relieve them of gas. This<br>
requires a special instrument for the purpose and no one should attempt<br>
to perform the operation unless they know the anatomy of the part, as<br>
the arteries of the intestines may be penetrated and produce internal<br>
hemorrhage or infection of the intestines, or abscesses may follow.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
WIND GALLS<br>
<br>
CAUSE: By concussions from fast work on hard roads and from sprains from<br>
slipping.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: When concussions alone are responsible, the suspensory<br>
ligament and the back tendons will at first be in a normal condition,<br>
and the swelling will probably be confined to both the inside and<br>
outside of the leg, and may be felt in the form of a puffy swelling on<br>
each side of the fetlock by placing the fore finger and the thumb on the<br>
joint. In more serious cases resulting from sprains, the vacant space<br>
between the back tendons and the suspensory ligament may also become<br>
filled with fluids. In other words, a Wind Gall has formed. In some<br>
cases the animal may be lame.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: When there is heat present apply cold, wet packs until the<br>
heat disappears. Then apply Tincture of Iodine, one ounce; Gum Camphor,<br>
two ounces; to one pint of Gasolene. Apply every three days with nail or<br>
tooth brush. Shake contents of the bottle well each time before<br>
applying.<br>
<br>
I may add that this is a very difficult blemish to treat and is not<br>
always successful, so do not be discouraged if the enlargements do not<br>
disappear, but the above prescription has proven the most successful of<br>
any treatment I have personally used in my private practice.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
WOLF OR SUPERNUMERARY TEETH<br>
<br>
Wolf Teeth are comparatively small in size and have only one root and<br>
are found just in front of the upper molar teeth. Sometimes they do<br>
harm, but that is an exception and not the rule. They can be easily<br>
removed with a pair of small forceps or they may be punched out in some<br>
instances.<br>
<br>
I think they interfere with the eyes, causing them to become watery and<br>
inflamed due to the tooth exerting some influence upon the ophthalmic<br>
division of the fifth nerve.<br>
<br>
Supernumerary Teeth: Tooth substance may develop in almost any part of<br>
the body. These are called Supernumerary Teeth and are most commonly<br>
found in the testicles, ovaries and sinuses of the head, etc.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
WOUNDS<br>
<br>
Wounds caused by external injuries have a general resemblance, and<br>
whether clean-cut, punctured, lacerated, poisonous, gunshot, etc.,<br>
require practically the same treatment.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Wash with a Carbolic solution, one tablespoonful to one pint<br>
of distilled water.<br>
<br>
SEWING OF WOUNDS: I cannot say that I am in favor of sewing wounds<br>
unless they are gaping or wide open.<br>
<br>
After the wound is washed, dust with Iodoform, Boracic Acid and Tannic<br>
Acid, each one ounce. Powder finely and place in a sifter top can and<br>
apply twice daily. Cord or heavy thread may be used for sewing the wound<br>
after being saturated in a Carbolic Acid solution, using a large darning<br>
needle. If the animal is vicious, place a twitch on his nose or it may<br>
be necessary to throw him.<br>

CHAPTER II<br>
<br>
<br>
ABSCESSES<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Bruises and injuries. They are also seen in complication with<br>
various other diseases, as Laryngitis, Pharyngitis, Tuberculosis, Lump<br>
Jaw, Blood Poison or Pyemia and Septicemia.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Symptoms will vary according to the nature of the disease or<br>
injury. It may not be noticed at first, but upon careful examination<br>
swollen lines will be observed running from the point of swelling. In<br>
many cases a swelling is noticed which is hot, painful and throbbing,<br>
which enlarges rapidly in two or three days. The swelling and heat<br>
gradually disappear but the Abscess continues to grow. The hair falls<br>
from the point of swelling and in a short time breaks and discharges<br>
pus. The cavity gradually fills up and heals by granulation.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: In all cases, hasten the ripening process as much as possible<br>
by applying hot water packs or hot bran, flaxseed or vegetable<br>
poultices. It is common with Veterinarians to lance an Abscess as soon<br>
as possible, but this requires considerable skill and practice and I<br>
would advise stock owners to be very cautious when performing this<br>
operation, as there is great danger of cutting arteries which would<br>
cause excessive bleeding. A very good plan is to encourage the full<br>
ripening of an Abscess, as above stated. When opened, do not squeeze the<br>
Abscess to any extent, but press gently with clean hands or cloth to<br>
remove the core or clot. After this, just simply keep the Abscess open<br>
by washing with a three per cent Carbolic Acid solution, or Bichloride<br>
of Mercury, one in one thousand solution. Hyposulphite of Soda in ounce<br>
doses should be given two or three times a day in their drinking water.<br>
This will prevent the absorption of impurities from the abscess into the<br>
blood circulation.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
ABORTION<br>
<br>
(Non-Contagious)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Injuries from slipping or falling on icy roads, in box cars, and<br>
deep gutters; receiving blows on the body, keeping the animal in<br>
insanitary stables, eating poor food that may be irritating or<br>
poisonous, etc. In such cases, the cow's vitality is low so that the<br>
foetus dies and is expelled as a result. Losing large quantities of<br>
blood also produces Abortion, or a cow heavy with calf, on being placed<br>
in the same quarters with the cows that retain their afterbirth, is<br>
liable to abort. Intestinal worms, lung worms, liver flukes, causing an<br>
excessive drain upon the system or producing irritation of the digestive<br>
organs, in consequence of which cow gets very poor and emaciated. The<br>
above mentioned are perhaps the most common causes of "Non-Contagious<br>
Abortion."<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: The cow is uneasy, becomes separated from the herd, the bag<br>
and vagina may be slightly inflamed and perhaps the latter discharging.<br>
If a cow heavy with calf craves the chewing and eating of dirt, rags,<br>
nails, etc., this is a sign of a lack of iron or phosphorus in her<br>
system and food containing these elements should be provided.<br>
<br>
PREVENTIVE TREATMENT: Provide clean, warm, comfortable quarters, good<br>
food, pure water to drink, do not subject her to any injuries, do not<br>
permit her coming in contact with cows retaining their afterbirth.<br>
<br>
The above mentioned is very important, especially if the cows are<br>
valuable and a large yield of milk is expected. If they have worms,<br>
treat the same as under their special heading. If they have a loss of<br>
blood or a lack of mineral matter in their system, the following is very<br>
efficient: Pulv. Ferri Sulphate, four ounces; Pulv. Nux Vomica, two<br>
ounces; Pulv. Fenugreek Seed, four ounces. Mix and make into sixteen<br>
powders. Give one powder two or three times a day in feed or place in a<br>
gelatin capsule and give with capsule gun.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
AMAUROSIS OF THE EYE<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Paralysis of the optic nerve.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Pupil fully dilated and of a glassy appearance. This condition<br>
is sometimes called "Glass Eye." The cow carries the head high and steps<br>
high. This condition is very uncommon in cattle.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Nothing can be done for a cow if she is blind, but this<br>
condition may be prevented if detected in its early stages of<br>
development by the proper feeding of nourishing food, good clean<br>
surroundings and the administration of nerve tonics, as Pulv. Nux<br>
Vomica, four ounces; Pulv. Gentian Root, four ounces; Potassium Iodide,<br>
three ounces. Make into twenty-four powders and place one powder in feed<br>
two or three times daily; or make into twenty-four capsules and give one<br>
capsule two or three times a day with capsule gun.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
ANTHRAX<br>
<br>
Anthrax is a very contagious disease and is communicable to all warm<br>
blooded animals and man.<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Due to the presence of a germ called the Bacillus of Anthrax and<br>
is one of the oldest diseases attributed to germs. These Bacilli thrive<br>
in warm climates, although found in cold countries. The infection is<br>
carried to various parts of the world by box-cars, ships, hides, hoofs,<br>
horns, wool and hair taken from sick or dead animals affected with<br>
Anthrax. This, perhaps, is the most common method of spreading the<br>
disease.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Loss of appetite, grinding of the teeth indicating great pain,<br>
trembling of the muscles, temperature elevated to 104 or 106 degrees F.,<br>
breathing very rapid, pulse fast and weak, hair rough. There are some<br>
cases where the animals are seized quickly with the disease and die very<br>
suddenly. This form resembles apoplexy. Carbuncles or Abscesses are seen<br>
on the surface of the body in nearly all cases, also a bloody discharge<br>
from the mouth and nose. The animal may stamp the ground, rear in the<br>
air, run and finally go into convulsions and die. This is termed "the<br>
furious form of Anthrax."<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Prevention is the most important. Fields or pastures that are<br>
infected with this disease should be burned every summer if possible, to<br>
destroy the germs. The animals that succumb to the disease should be<br>
buried deeply and quicklime thrown upon them, also any blood stains upon<br>
the ground should have a strong disinfectant thrown upon them. The hide<br>
of such an animal should not be used as the person removing it is likely<br>
to contract the same disease, especially if an abrasion is present on<br>
the hand, or such a hide or any portion thereof is likely to spread the<br>
infection after reaching the tannery, etc.<br>
<br>
MEDICAL TREATMENT OR SERUM TREATMENT: This is the only thorough method<br>
of eradicating the disease, and when this disease once becomes prevalent<br>
in a locality the services of a competent Veterinarian should be secured<br>
and all the animals inoculated.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
BARRENNESS<br>
<br>
(Failure to Breed)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Wasting or Atrophy, chronic inflammation of the mucous membrane<br>
lining the organs of generation, Whites, absence or excessive secretions<br>
of the organs of generation, contraction or displacement of the womb,<br>
horns being telescoped or twisted, cysts or growths of the ovaries,<br>
in-breeding or being a twin, are the predisposing causes of Barrenness.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Unsuccessful as a rule. Unless the cow is very valuable,<br>
treatment is not advisable. A careful examination, however, is<br>
recommended. If due to contraction of the neck of the womb it can be<br>
readily dilated by the use of the hand, after being greased with<br>
Carbolated Sweet Oil before attempting to perform the operation.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
BLACK LEG<br>
<br>
(Symptomatic Anthrax--Black Quarter)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Due to germs. The Bacillus of Black Leg perhaps gains entrance to<br>
the blood by wounds of the skin or the mucous membranes lining the mouth<br>
and the intestines. This disease principally affects cattle, although<br>
sheep and goats may become affected with the same disease.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: This disease affects cattle that are in good condition between<br>
the ages of six months and two years. In most cases death is very<br>
sudden, and perhaps the animal is found dead. The first symptoms are<br>
high temperatures from 104 to 108 degrees F., loss of appetite, the<br>
animal stops chewing the cud, breathing considerably hurried, the joints<br>
of the limbs become swollen, also the chest and shoulders. All the<br>
swellings are painful on pressure and spread very rapidly over the body.<br>
The affected animals move with great difficulty and lie down frequently.<br>
If the hand is passed over the body, there is a peculiar crackling sound<br>
due to the gas developing under the skin. At the most distended portions<br>
of the swellings, the skin becomes dry and the animal apparently has no<br>
sense of feeling. If the skin is punctured at this place, there will be<br>
a dark-red, frothy discharge which has a very disagreeable odor. There<br>
will be a shivering of the muscles and the animal dies from convulsions.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Remove non-affected animals to non-infected pastures, and<br>
confine affected animals to as small a territory as possible. The<br>
carcasses of the dead animals should be buried deep and covered with<br>
lime or burned, being very careful that all blood stains on the ground<br>
where the animals have been skinned are thoroughly disinfected.<br>
Inoculation is necessary, and is the best form of treatment in<br>
localities where Black Leg exists. Inoculate or vaccinate the calves<br>
when six months old or over, although after the animal reaches the age<br>
of two years or over they generally become immune from this disease.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
BLEEDING<br>
<br>
(Hemorrhage)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Sometimes bleeding follows dehorning, castration, and wounds due<br>
to various other causes.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: When bleeding from a large artery, it should be tied with a<br>
clean silk or linen thread or twisted with a pair of forceps or<br>
cauterized with a hot iron. Sometimes compression by the use of tightly<br>
bound bandages proves effective, although the former appliances are more<br>
practical. Tincture Chloride of Iron applied to small arteries or veins<br>
causes the blood to clot in the arteries or veins and hence stops the<br>
Hemorrhage. It is very essential that all wounds should be treated<br>
antiseptically and I cannot say that I favor washing a wound with water<br>
only in cases where the wound is very filthy, and I prefer powder<br>
applications in preference to any other antiseptics. The following will<br>
be found very effective in the treatment of the majority of wounds:<br>
Boracic Acid, two ounces; Iodoform, two drams; Tannic Acid, one-half<br>
ounce; Calomel, one dram. Powder finely and mix well. Place in sifter<br>
top can and apply two or three times daily.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
BLOATING<br>
<br>
A very common disorder in cattle and characterized by a puffed up<br>
appearance of the left flank. The cow has four stomachs of which the<br>
rumen is the largest, its capacity being about fifty gallons in the<br>
average cow, and it is this stomach which fills with gas when a cow<br>
bloats.<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Eating green clover or alfalfa; even when a cow is accustomed to<br>
this diet, it may cause bloating if wet with dew or rain; cured alfalfa,<br>
moldy or frozen mangles will also produce bloating; the above mentioned<br>
foods undergo a process of fermentation which causes excessive formation<br>
of gas, and death may result very quickly and may be due to rupture of<br>
the stomach or the diaphragm (muscle separating the abdominal and lung<br>
cavities), but is more often due to suffocation caused by the distension<br>
of the stomach which becomes so large that it presses the diaphragm<br>
forward against the lungs in such a manner as to stop their movement and<br>
the animal smothers. When the cow falls, it indicates that one of these<br>
possibilities has occurred and death follows quickly.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Cattle usually bloat suddenly and without warning; the left<br>
flank becomes abnormally swollen; back is arched, breathing labored;<br>
sometimes the tongue hangs out and the animal bellows. When rupture or<br>
suffocation occurs the animal reels, staggers, and falls, after which<br>
nothing more can be done.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: No time should be lost. Where the stomach is enormously<br>
distended with gas so as to cause the animals to stagger and breathe<br>
very rapidly, they should be gagged. This can be easily accomplished by<br>
taking a piece of wood about two inches in diameter, and eight inches to<br>
one foot long, placing it in their mouth and retaining it in that<br>
position by tying a string on each end and placing it back of the ears.<br>
If this does not give relief immediately, puncture the left flank about<br>
five inches downward and forward from the angle of hip bone. However,<br>
puncturing should not be resorted to only in cases where death threatens<br>
the animal, as abscesses, infection and severe hemorrhage may
follow.&nbsp; A<br>
very reliable medical treatment for this condition should be in the<br>
medicine chest of every stockman, such as Pulv. Asafetida, Oil of<br>
Turpentine, each one ounce. Place in gelatin capsules. This is a very<br>
efficient remedy for the eradication of excessive fermentation of gases<br>
in the stomach or bloating.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
BLOOD POISON<br>
<br>
(Pyemia-Septicaemia)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Due to a septic infection taken into the blood, frequently found<br>
in cows with retained afterbirths, following inflammation of the womb or<br>
intestines, wounds and bruises of the skin and frequently found in<br>
calves affected with Joint Ill.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: High temperature 103 to 107 degrees F., pulse rapid and<br>
feeble, breathing increased, grinding of the teeth, the animal refuses<br>
to eat in most cases and ceases to chew the cud, although there may be<br>
great thirst present. Abscesses may form in various parts of the body,<br>
the membranes of the eyes and mouth will be injected with blood, giving<br>
them a dark-red appearance, although in the latter stages of Blood<br>
Poison this may change to a yellowish tinge. Constipation or Diarrhoea<br>
may be connected with the disease. The animal dies by general emaciation<br>
from four to six days after the first symptoms are noticed.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Unsuccessful, as when the infection once becomes absorbed in<br>
the blood it is always certain that death will follow. If due to<br>
injuries or wounds, wash them with Bichloride solution, one part to one<br>
thousand parts of water, but if due to retained afterbirth or<br>
inflammation of the womb, inject one gallon of distilled water<br>
containing five per cent Carbolic Acid. If in young calves, treat the<br>
same as under the heading of Joint Ill. If due to inflammation of the<br>
intestines, give Hyposulphite of Soda, two ounces; Potassi Iodide, one<br>
dram, two or three times a day in their drinking water. When abscesses<br>
form, lance them with a clean, sharp knife. If the animal is constipated<br>
place two drams of Aloin, two drams of Pulv. Gentian Root in a capsule<br>
and give with capsule gun. If Diarrhoea is present give Gum Catechu, two<br>
drams; Protan, three drams; Zinc Sulphocarbolates, one grain. Place in<br>
gelatin capsule and give with capsule gun. Feed warm wheat bran mashes,<br>
steamed rolled oats, vegetables and green grass, if possible.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
BLOODY FLUX<br>
<br>
(Dysentery)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Chilling of the outer surface of the body. Improper feeding, as<br>
contaminated food or water, sometimes connected with parasitic diseases<br>
of the intestines.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Dysentery is a sign of some irritation of the intestines<br>
terminating into increased contractions of muscular fibers of the<br>
bowels. The fecal matter, if frequently expelled, at first consists of a<br>
thick feces, but as the disease progresses the fecal matter becomes very<br>
thin and watery and tinged with blood and very offensive. When the first<br>
signs are noticed the animals show no constitutional disturbances, but<br>
later they exhibit abdominal pain by looking around to the flank. At<br>
this stage they are very weak, throwing the feet well together, giving<br>
the back an arched appearance, and are very uneasy although they may lie<br>
down frequently. Temperature elevated from one to three degrees. The<br>
animal becomes emaciated and eventually dies.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Determine the cause and remove it if possible. Keep the<br>
animal quiet. Give pure water to drink in small quantities but often. If<br>
the animal will eat, feed steamed rolled oats, etc. Flaxseed tea is very<br>
beneficial, as it is soothing to the intestines and assists in removing<br>
the irritations. Pour one quart of boiling water on one-half pint of<br>
pure Flaxseed, allowing it to cool, then compel the animal to drink it.<br>
The following prescription will be found very effective in all forms of<br>
Diarrhoea: Tannic Acid, one ounce; Protan, two ounces; Gum Catechu, two<br>
ounces; Beechwood Creosote, four scruples; Zinc Sulphocarbolates, eight<br>
grains. Make into eight capsules and give one capsule every three or<br>
four hours with capsule gun.<br>

DAIRY HERD AT OAKLAWN FARM, WAYNE, ILLS. (DUNHAMS.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
BLOODY MILK<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Bloody Milk may be the result of injury, congestion, inflammation<br>
of the udder. Feeding on rich milk-producing food suddenly may produce<br>
it. Bloody Milk is also produced in a cow by excitement when in heat or<br>
from eating resinous plants or shrubs.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: It is advisable in most cases to give a physic consisting of<br>
two drams of Aloin and Ginger two drams. Also administer Potassium<br>
Nitrate, four ounces; Potassium Chlorate, two ounces, made into eight<br>
capsules and give one capsule twice daily with capsule gun. If due to<br>
rich food, reduce it. If due to eating resinous plants, remove them from<br>
the pasture containing such shrubbery. Where congestion or inflammation<br>
of the bag is thought to produce it, apply Hot Water Packs, then dry and<br>
apply Blue Ointment and Camphorated Ointment, equal parts, two ounces.<br>
Mix well and rub on thoroughly two or three times a day.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
BLUE MILK<br>
<br>
CAUSE: This condition is due to a germ (the Bacillus Cyanogenes) which<br>
may occur in rich milk or cream immediately after being drawn or the<br>
germ may find its way into the opening of the teat.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Injections into the teat of a solution composed of the<br>
following: Hyposulphite of Soda, two drams; Boracic Acid, one dram,<br>
dissolved in one pint of boiling water. Permit to cool and inject a<br>
small quantity in each teat once or twice a day for three or four days.<br>
This will destroy the Blue Milk producing germ without any injuries to<br>
the cow, udder or teats.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
BRONCHITIS<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Inhaling irritating gases or foreign bodies. It is commonly seen<br>
after drenching from liquid escaping into the windpipe instead of going<br>
down the gullet. Animals exposed to cold, wet weather when not<br>
accustomed to it frequently develop Bronchitis.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Loss of appetite, chilling, temperature elevated two or three<br>
degrees above normal; ears and legs cold, nose hot and dry, breathing<br>
short and labored, painful coughing, slight discharge from the nostrils<br>
and saliva oozing from the mouth. If the ear is placed over the lower<br>
portion of the neck, a crepitating sound can be heard.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Place the animal in a clean, comfortable stall where there is<br>
pure air and light but no drafts. Clothe the body if the weather is<br>
cold. Hand rub the legs and bandage with woolen cloths. Give inhalations<br>
of steam from Hot Water and Pine Tar for twenty minutes two or three<br>
times a day. Also administer Nux Vomica, four ounces; Ginger, four<br>
ounces; Nitrate of Potash, four ounces. Make into sixteen capsules and<br>
give one capsule every four hours. Applications of the following<br>
liniment are of some value: Aqua Ammonia Fort., three ounces; Oil of<br>
Turpentine, three ounces; Sweet Oil, six ounces. Apply over the region<br>
of the windpipe the full length of the neck.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CALF SCOURS<br>
<br>
(Cholera--White Scours--Bloody Flux)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: It is produced by a specific germ and is communicated by direct<br>
or indirect contact with the germ which may gain entrance into the blood<br>
by the umbilical cord at or shortly after birth or through the digestive<br>
canal by drinking milk or eating food contaminated with the<br>
disease-producing germ. The more common means of spreading the disease<br>
is through pails, drinking troughs, etc.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: One of the most deadly forms of Diarrhoea. This usually<br>
appears a few days after birth, although in some cases it takes several<br>
days for it to develop. Every sign of Diarrhoea is present, as frequent<br>
passages of feces of a yellowish-white color, frothy and very offensive<br>
in odor. The calf is very dull, weak, back arched, hair rough, eyes<br>
glassy and sunken back in their sockets, belly retracted, breathing<br>
short and fast. The calf finally lies flat on the side, head resting on<br>
the floor or ground with a temperature generally below normal. The calf<br>
finally becomes unconscious and death follows.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Give Protan, three ounces; Zinc Sulphocarbolates, eight<br>
grains; Gum Catechu, powdered, two ounces; Ginger, one ounce; Beechwood<br>
Creosote, one dram. Make into eight capsules and give one capsule every<br>
two hours until relieved. When the calf will take its feed, if not<br>
nursing its mother, see that the milk is pure and the utensil containing<br>
it thoroughly scalded with hot water. Keep the animal in clean, sanitary<br>
quarters, as quiet as possible for a few days, and if the disease is not<br>
too far advanced a good recovery will follow.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CALVING<br>
<br>
Signs of Normal Calving are firmness and enlargement of the udder,<br>
extending well forward following the milk veins. The teats as a rule<br>
discharge a thin milky fluid, relaxation of the muscles on each side of<br>
the croup or the base of the tail. The outer surface of the womb becomes<br>
swollen and inflamed, discharging sticky, stringy, transparent mucus.<br>
The cow becomes uneasy, stops eating, and if in a pasture becomes<br>
separated from the rest of the herd; will lie down and get up<br>
alternately as if in great agony. When birth pains start, the back is<br>
arched, and a severe straining follows the contraction of the abdominal<br>
muscles. The membranes covering the foetus will be the first to make<br>
their appearance, engorged with a fluid from the womb. This is commonly<br>
known as the water bag, which eventually bursts and the two fore feet<br>
can be seen, and, as the animal continues to strain, the nose and head<br>
will be next to be seen. When the calf's shoulders are exposed, the cow<br>
as a rule rises suddenly to her feet and the entire calf is expelled,<br>
also the membranes surrounding it, but the membranes next to the womb,<br>
as a general rule, remain longer and sometimes require artificial<br>
assistance to remove them. (See Retention of the Afterbirth.) Destroy<br>
the foetal membranes by burning or burying them deeply. Do not permit<br>
the cow to eat them. Wash the calf's navel with Bichloride of Mercury,<br>
one part to one thousand parts water, once or twice a day until the<br>
navel is thoroughly dry, as an infection may follow, producing Joint Ill<br>
or Scours, from which death may result.<br>
<br>
ABNORMAL CALVING: This is a condition where the foetus is not normally<br>
presented, as that just described. Their feet may be presented in a<br>
normal manner, but the head and neck twisted back or to one side, or the<br>
head and one fore foot may be presented normally, while the other fore<br>
foot is doubled back, or there may be a breech presentation as the rump<br>
of a foetus with both hind feet thrown close to its body. This is a very<br>
difficult presentation, especially if in a young animal. A foetus<br>
abnormally presented requires good judgment and cleanliness, also<br>
lubrication of the walls of the womb with unsalted Lard, Cotton or Sweet<br>
Oil. Endeavor to place the foetus in as near a normal position as<br>
possible before any force is used in its delivery, although where both<br>
hind feet are presented, it is advisable to remove it in this position.<br>
The hands and ropes should be clean and washed with a five per cent<br>
solution of Carbolic Acid. It is not only dangerous to the animal, but<br>
to the operator as well, if proper antiseptic precautions are not<br>
practiced.<br>
<br>
Space does not permit me going into details on various foetal<br>
presentations nor does it permit me to explain the exact methods or<br>
operations I would use in each particular case. Nevertheless, good<br>
judgment and cleanliness are important. Do not hurry. Take your time,<br>
and you will be successful in most cases.<br>
<br>
When the foetus is removed, and the afterbirth does not come away within<br>
twelve or eighteen hours, remove it. (See Retention of Afterbirth, which<br>
will describe its means of attachment and its removal.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CASTING THE WITHERS<br>
<br>
(Eversion of the Womb)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Failure of the womb to contract after Calving. If the womb<br>
contracts naturally and the afterbirth expelled, the cavity of the womb<br>
is nearly closed and the neck of the womb becomes so narrow that the<br>
hand cannot be inserted.&nbsp;&nbsp; When the womb fails to contract,
one or both<br>
horns of the womb become so relaxed that they fall into the cavity<br>
causing straining and contraction of the abdominal muscles, forcing the<br>
womb out gradually until the organ is turned inside out. The womb can be<br>
easily distinguished from the other membranes on account of the presence<br>
of sixty to eighty mushroom-like bodies (cotyledons) two to four inches<br>
in diameter attached to the walls of the womb by a narrow neck. The womb<br>
when hanging out becomes engorged with blood and inflamed until it is as<br>
large as a grain sack, very dark in color, tears and bleeds with the<br>
slightest touch. Later it becomes lacerated and gangrenous.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: At first, the general health is not very much interfered with,<br>
but the inflammation which is marked by an elevation in temperature<br>
becomes very noticeable, accompanied by severe straining and exhaustion.<br>
The animal lies down, but continues to strain until death, unless relief<br>
is afforded the animal at once.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Great care must be exercised. The parts of the womb coming in<br>
contact with the cow's hips, tail or floors must be thoroughly washed<br>
with a five per cent solution of Carbolic Acid, using a soft cloth or<br>
sponge to remove dirt, clots, etc. Place the cow in a position so as to<br>
have her hind quarters much higher than the head, and then endeavor to<br>
replace the womb. After washing as stated above, bandage the tail with a<br>
clean cloth; have an assistant hold up the womb and the operator use<br>
gentle manipulation and pressure with clean hands; this perhaps is the<br>
best method of replacing the womb. Then follow by flushing out the womb<br>
with a weak Carbolic Acid solution and luke warm water. This has a<br>
tendency to straighten out the horns of the uterus and prevent<br>
infection. If the cow continues to strain, give Potassium Bromide in<br>
ounce doses every two or three hours in her drinking water, or place in<br>
capsule and give with capsule gun.<br>
<br>
Sometimes stimulants and tonics are necessary and the following will be<br>
found very effective: Pulv. Nux Vomica, four ounces; Pulv. Gentian Root,<br>
four ounces; Pulv. Ferri Sulphate, four ounces. Make into sixteen<br>
capsules and give one capsule every six hours with capsule gun.<br>
<br>
It is well to compel the animal to stand or lie with the hind parts<br>
elevated, until the signs of straining have ceased.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CATARACT OF THE EYE<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Is due to deep seated inflammation of the eye produced by an<br>
injury or weakened condition of the optic nerve.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: If the pupil of one of the eyes appears larger than the other<br>
it is well to make a careful examination, as this is the first sign of<br>
Cataract. If such a condition is neglected, partial or complete<br>
blindness will follow and a white, pearly deposit can be seen on the<br>
lens of the eye.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Very unsatisfactory unless treated carefully when the first<br>
signs are noticed. Place the animal in a darkened stable. Feed clean,<br>
sloppy food and it may be necessary to give a physic consisting of two<br>
drams of Aloin, two drams of Pulv. Ginger, placed in a capsule and given<br>
with capsule gun. The following ointment, Yellow Oxide of Mercury, four<br>
grains; Lanolin, one ounce, should be mixed well and applied to the eye<br>
two or three times a day.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CATARRH<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Ill ventilated stables, inhalations of irritating gases or sudden<br>
exposure to cold, wet weather, after being accustomed to warm stables.<br>
Most commonly seen in the Spring or Fall.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Chilling and temperature elevated one or two degrees, pulse<br>
not much affected, breathing hurried to some extent, sneezing, coughing,<br>
dullness and the appetite is slightly impaired. In the first stages the<br>
nostrils are very dry and considerably inflamed, but in the course of a<br>
few days the fever subsides and a profuse discharge from the nose is<br>
observed.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Place the animal in dry, well ventilated stall, blanket well<br>
and supply a good quality and quantity of bedding. Give inhalations from<br>
steam and hot water and Pine Tar. If the animal is constipated, give<br>
rectal injections of Soap and Warm Water two or three times a day. Also<br>
administer Potassium Nitrate, Pulv. Nux Vomica, each four ounces;<br>
Capsicum, two ounces, and Pulv. Ginger two ounces. Make into twenty-four<br>
capsules and give one capsule three or four times a day. This should not<br>
be neglected, as neglected Catarrh is liable to be followed by<br>
Laryngitis, Bronchitis, Pneumonia, Pleurisy or other diseases of the<br>
organs of breathing, which are very serious and sometimes cause the<br>
death of the animal.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPPED TEATS<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Anything that tends to irritate them. A sudden chilling of the<br>
teat in cold weather after the calf has just let it go, or after the<br>
operation of milking with wet hands or from an animal wading through<br>
deep water or tall wet grass. Also filth or irritants coming in contact<br>
with teats when lying down.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Remove the cause if possible and dry the teats well after<br>
each milking and apply Zinc Oxide ointment. Feed laxative food that is<br>
easily digested, as it has a very good effect on the blood, consequently<br>
it promotes the healing of wounds.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHOKING<br>
<br>
(Obstruction of the Esophagus)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: An obstruction of the Esophagus (gullet) produced by an animal<br>
attempting to swallow apples, potatoes, roots, dry grain, etc.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: A stringy discharge of saliva from the mouth, violent<br>
coughing, wrenching of the head and neck. The animal will bloat very<br>
quickly if the Esophagus or gullet is completely obstructed.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: The obstruction as a rule is easily located, and as quickly<br>
as possible withdraw the obstruction by inserting the hand and<br>
extracting the object. Do not attempt to push the object down into the<br>
stomach, except as a last resort, as there is a great deal of danger of<br>
rupturing the Esophagus or gullet. Push the object upward by gentle<br>
manipulation from the outside. If this fails, a smooth piece of hose<br>
about eight or nine feet long, well greased with Lard, Butter or Oil,<br>
should be passed down the Esophagus or gullet. A block of wood about two<br>
inches in diameter with a hole bored through the center just a little<br>
larger than the hose, placed in the mouth, will prevent the animal from<br>
biting the hose, and make the operation easier.<br>
<br>
When the animal is bloated severely, puncture with a knife about four or<br>
five inches from the point of the hip downward and forward.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHRONIC DYSENTERY<br>
<br>
(Bacterial Dysentery--Jones Disease)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Acid-fast Bacillus resembling the Tubercular Bacillus that invade<br>
the intestines by the way of the animal drinking water or eating food<br>
containing the Acid-fast Bacteria.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Diarrhoea, loss of flesh, although the appetite is good, hair<br>
becomes dry and harsh, temperature remains about normal. The Diarrhoea<br>
becomes persistent and tinged with blood. The animal becomes emaciated<br>
and anemic, exhausted, and death follows. This disease may continue for<br>
a month or even a year before death takes place. However this is very<br>
uncommon. They generally die very shortly.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Separate the affected cattle from the healthy ones. All fecal<br>
matter should be deeply buried or burned, the stalls, barnyards, also<br>
thoroughly disinfected. Administration of medicine thus far has been<br>
unsatisfactory, although a treatment should be directed toward the<br>
intestines with internal antiseptics such as Zinc Sulphocarbolates, one<br>
and one-half grains; Protan, three drams; Pulv. Nux Vomica, one dram;<br>
Bismuth Subnitrate, one dram. Place in gelatin capsule and give with<br>
capsule gun. This dose should be repeated three or four times a day.<br>
Feed a good quality of food, such as wheat bran mashes or steamed rolled<br>
oats and see that the water supply is fresh and non-contaminated.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
COLIC<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Drinking large quantities of cold water when overheated. However,<br>
this disorder is very uncommon in cattle owing to the fact that they are<br>
not worked, seldom overheated and drink water very slowly.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Kicking or raising of the feet to the belly. Lying down and<br>
getting up alternately. Distention of the stomach or paunch with gas.<br>
The animal chills or shivers, etc.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Strong stimulants or tonics as the following will give<br>
immediate results if administered in its first stages: Pulv. Nux Vomica,<br>
two ounces; Pulv. Ginger, two ounces; Pulv. Capsicum, two ounces. Make<br>
into eight capsules and give one capsule every two hours until relieved.<br>
Give the capsules with capsule gun. If severe bloating accompanies a<br>
case of Colic in cattle place one ounce dose of Oil of Turpentine in<br>
ounce capsules and give with capsule gun.<br>
<br>

Owned by C. S. Hetehncr, Chariton, Iowa.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CONGESTION OF THE LUNGS<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Cattle permitted to stand in drafts when warm after being driven,<br>
etc., irritating drugs escaping into the lungs when drenching, as it is<br>
very difficult for cattle to swallow when their heads are elevated.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Dullness. The animal loses its spirits, so to speak, usually<br>
shivers or trembles. When this ceases, the temperature rises to perhaps<br>
105 or 106 degrees F. The ears and legs grow cold, the nose hot and dry,<br>
pulse rapid but firm, breathing short and labored, a short hacking cough<br>
will be present. Such animals generally remain standing.<br>
<br>
Other symptoms are constipation, the feces covered with mucus or a<br>
slime, great thirst. The eyes are inflamed and look glassy. The<br>
secretions of milk are suppressed, if these symptoms develop in milking<br>
cows.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Place the animal in clean, warm, comfortable quarters<br>
permitting light and as much pure air as possible, but avoid drafts and<br>
blanket the animal if chilly. Hand rub the legs and bandage with woolen<br>
cloths. Administer Pulv. Carbonate of Ammonia, four ounces; Pulv. Nux<br>
Vomica, three ounces; Quinine, two ounces; Nitrate of Potash, two<br>
ounces; Potassium Iodide, one ounce. Make into twenty-four capsules and<br>
give one capsule every four hours with capsule gun. Also apply a paste<br>
made from Mustard and cold water over the lung cavities just back of the<br>
fore legs. Apply once a day and perhaps one or two applications will be<br>
sufficient.<br>
<br>
If this disease is treated when the first symptoms develop, a good<br>
recovery will follow. Feed easily digested food as hot wheat bran mashes<br>
or steamed rolled oats, vegetables and green grass if possible.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CONTAGIOUS ABORTION<br>
<br>
(Infectious Abortion)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Due to a germ (Bacillus Abortus) coming in direct contact with<br>
the genital organs of a bull or cow and can be indefinitely transmitted<br>
from one herd to another by infected bulls serving healthy cows, or<br>
infected cows when served transmit the infection to healthy bulls.<br>
Healthy cows become infected by their genital organs coming in contact<br>
with litter on floors when lying down or rubbing against fences, walls<br>
or posts previously soiled by aborting cows. Cattle licking one another<br>
is also a prolific cause.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: The signs of calving are not so well marked as in normal<br>
calving, especially where the aborting animal is a heifer and the<br>
gestation period has not exceeded three or four weeks. In cows,<br>
especially where the gestation period has advanced to five or seven<br>
months, the symptoms are easily detected as a rule by a swelling of the<br>
udder, or what is commonly termed "making bag," the outer portions of<br>
the womb swollen and inflamed as in normal calving. As the period of<br>
abortion approaches, there will be a discharge of mucus and blood from<br>
the womb. Labor pains are not as severe as in normal calving, owing to<br>
the absence of hair on the foetus and being smaller; although the<br>
afterbirth (foetal membranes), may be retained the same as in normal<br>
calving.<br>
<br>
PREVENTIVE TREATMENT: This perhaps is the cheapest and best method of<br>
treating Contagious Abortion. When purchasing bulls or cows, ascertain<br>
whether the farm you purchased from has Contagious Abortion. An<br>
investigation of this kind often saves labor, time and money.<br>
<br>
MEDICAL TREATMENT: When once Contagious Abortion makes its appearance,<br>
separate infected from non-infected animals, remove all litter, manure,<br>
etc., from barns, corrals, and burn or bury deeply. The conveyances used<br>
should be tight so as to prevent scattering. Scrub and disinfect floors,<br>
fences, walls of barns and rubbing posts with a solution made from three<br>
pounds of Copper Sulphate to ten gallons of water, permitting it to<br>
thoroughly dissolve before using. Use an ordinary barrel and cover so as<br>
to prevent any cattle drinking same, as it is very
poisonous.&nbsp;&nbsp; When a<br>
cow aborts, remove the calf and afterbirth in a tight receptacle that<br>
will prevent any portion from being scattered, and burn or bury deeply;<br>
disinfect the floor and walls of stall where the abortion took place as<br>
long as the cow is discharging any fluids from the womb. A gallon of<br>
distilled or boiled water containing about one per cent Carbolic Acid<br>
should be injected into the womb with an ordinary hose and funnel. This<br>
should be repeated once a day for a week. Use a solution of the same<br>
strength for washing the tail and parts around the outer part of the<br>
womb, or in fact any part that the discharge of an aborting cow may come<br>
in contact with.<br>
<br>
Internally, give Methylen Blue in thirty grain doses, every other day<br>
for two weeks. This is an exceptionally disagreeable drug to administer<br>
as it stains everything it comes in contact with. Place it in a gelatin<br>
capsule or have your druggist prepare six or seven capsules containing<br>
thirty grains each. Then administer with capsule gun. Insist on pure<br>
Methylen Blue, accept no substitute. This treatment has proven very<br>
effective in many localities where strict aseptic precautions were<br>
carried out, as washing out the womb or any parts that the discharge of<br>
an aborting cow may come in contact with and proper cleanliness and<br>
disinfection of stables, etc. Cows should not be bred for several weeks<br>
following abortion or as long as there is a discharge present. Bulls<br>
should be treated in much the same way, as administering Methylen Blue<br>
in same size doses for the same length of time as that of the cow. But<br>
in addition to this, use a one per cent solution of Carbolic Acid for<br>
injecting into the bull's sheath, holding the end of the sheath while<br>
the solution is being injected, until it is well distended; holding the<br>
opening of the sheath allowing the solution to remain as long as<br>
convenient. Also, wash belly, muzzle, etc., with a solution of the same<br>
strength.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
COUGH<br>
<br>
(Acute and Chronic)<br>
<br>
As a cough is a symptom of various diseases, these in addition to the<br>
cough should be treated.<br>
<br>
KINDS OF COUGH: Many writers give several different varieties, but for<br>
the sake of convenience I will divide them into two forms, namely: Acute<br>
and Chronic.<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Acute coughs are generally due to sudden exposure to cold, drafts<br>
and are the forerunning symptom of a disease of the organs of breathing.<br>
<br>
Chronic Coughs are associated with, and are a result of sore throat,<br>
lung fever, pleurisy, bronchitis, catarrh and tuberculosis.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Under each disease, of which a cough is a symptom, I have<br>
also prescribed to include its suppression. The following prescription<br>
is reasonable in price, yet very effective in all forms of cough: Tannic<br>
Acid, one ounce; Potassi Chlorate, four ounces; Potassi Nitrate, four<br>
ounces. Powder well and mix with Black Strap Molasses, one pint, placing<br>
container retaining the above in hot water, which assists in dissolving.<br>
When this is thoroughly mixed, add Pine Tar, one pint, and place one<br>
tablespoonful well back on the tongue with a wooden paddle every three<br>
or four hours, according to the severity of the cough.<br>
<br>
Sometimes a liniment applied to the throat and windpipe has a good<br>
effect, and I would recommend the following on account of its<br>
penetrating qualities: Aqua Ammonia Fort., two ounces; Turpentine, two<br>
ounces; Raw Linseed Oil, four ounces. Mix and apply twice daily, shaking<br>
the contents of the bottle well before using.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
COWPOX<br>
<br>
(Variola)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Investigations lead us to believe that it is due to a protozoa.<br>
So far, the true micro-organism has not been discovered. This disease is<br>
very contagious and is transmitted by direct communication but not<br>
through the air. Perhaps the most common way of transmitting the disease<br>
is by the hands of the milker.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: A slight raise in the temperature, especially that of the<br>
udder and teats. They are red, swollen and tender and after three or<br>
four days small pimples or pustules will appear on the teats about the<br>
size of a pea. The pimples or pustules become larger and within a few<br>
days may attain the size of one-half inch in diameter. At the end of the<br>
second week the pimples or pustules burst and discharge an amber colored<br>
fluid leaving raw sores, which cause the animal to suffer intensely when<br>
being milked. The supply of milk is also markedly decreased in this<br>
condition.<br>
<br>
PREVENTION: A person should not milk both healthy and diseased cows<br>
unless the hands are thoroughly washed in a Carbolated Solution; the<br>
clothes that are likely to come in contact with the udder, coat sleeves,<br>
etc., changed.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: It is advisable to give a physic as it has a very good effect<br>
on the blood, such as Aloin, two drams, and Ginger, two drams, which is<br>
easily prepared and administered by placing in capsule and giving with<br>
capsule gun.<br>
<br>
Also, the application of Zinc Ointment two or three times a day affords<br>
immediate relief and causes the sores to heal rapidly. Good results are<br>
also obtained by feeding food that is easily digested, as bran mashes,<br>
steamed rolled oats and vegetables.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CUD CHEWING<br>
<br>
(Physiology of Rumination)<br>
<br>
The cow when eating grass or hay merely moistens it with saliva and<br>
swallows, then it passes into the rumen or paunch which acts as a<br>
storehouse or reservoir for food. After the paunch or rumen is filled,<br>
the cow finds a comfortable place to stand or lie down and she<br>
regurgitates it into the mouth by a contraction of the muscles of the<br>
walls of the esophagus in small quantities or pellets from the rumen or<br>
paunch back into the mouth and is there masticated. When it is chewed<br>
finely she swallows and it passes into the second stomach and is there<br>
digested for assimilation.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
DIARRHOEA<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Giving rich succulent foods after being fed on stimulating diets<br>
for some time, and such a case may be a benefit to the animal instead of<br>
an injury. Turnips, carrots, etc., especially if frozen slightly, are<br>
apt to produce it. Also impure and stagnant water which acts as a poison<br>
or some irritant in the food, as sand, clay, etc., or it may result from<br>
excitement, as driving cattle or shipping cattle in cars when not<br>
accustomed to it. Or, it may be the result of an overdose of irritating<br>
medicines. Diarrhoea as a rule is not fatal. It is often an effort of<br>
nature to relieve some disease, as poison in the blood. The easiest way<br>
to get rid of it is by way of the bowels.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: It is easily detected. An animal passes large amounts of feces<br>
which are of a liquid nature. At first the pulse is but little affected,<br>
but after a day or two it becomes weak and slightly increased. If it<br>
continues for a few days the pulse increases, the ears and legs get<br>
colder than normal, there are slight gripping pains in some cases due to<br>
slight irritation or perhaps to slight spasm of the intestines. These<br>
pains may increase and result in inflammation of the bowels, especially<br>
if the cause is due to stagnant water or irritating drugs.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: In many cases all you have to do is to change the food and<br>
clothe the body according to the temperature. Do not let the animal<br>
drink large quantities of water at one time. Give pure water in small<br>
quantities, but often, and it may be necessary to give medicines.<br>
Endeavor to find out the cause and if due to some irritant in the<br>
intestines, prepare Flaxseed tea by pouring a quart of boiling water on<br>
a half pint of pure Flaxseed, allowing it to cool. Compel the animal to<br>
drink it. This is very soothing to the bowels when irritated and also<br>
beneficial in removing the irritant; in cases where the Diarrhoea<br>
continues for some time, it is necessary to stop it by administering Gum<br>
Catechu, two ounces; Protan, two ounces; Zinc Sulphocarbolates, eight<br>
grains. Mix and make into eight capsules and give one capsule every four<br>
hours with capsule gun. Keep the animal as quiet as possible and feed<br>
non-irritating food that is easily digested, as steamed barley or oats.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
DEHORNING<br>
<br>
Dehorning is not considered a cruelty as some people hold it, as horns<br>
on cattle do not only add discomfort to themselves but add to the<br>
owner's risk. It is much better, safer and I think more humane to<br>
prevent the growth of horns on calves after they are three or four days<br>
old by rubbing the elevations where the horns make their appearance with<br>
a pencil of Caustic Potash after being moistened with cold water. Repeat<br>
this application two or three times, which is generally sufficient.<br>
<br>
When dehorning cattle with clippers or saw, it is well to remove about<br>
one-half inch of the flesh of the horn. This gives their head a much<br>
better appearance after the horns are removed and healed. When a horn is<br>
freshly amputated, apply Oil of Tar occasionally, as it is an antiseptic<br>
and prevents infection and the annoyance of flies. However, this should<br>
be performed during the season when the flies are less numerous.<br>

<br>
DROPSY<br>
<br>
(Ascities)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Usually seen in old animals or cattle fed on poor food where the<br>
blood becomes so poor, so to speak, that Dropsy follows, The presence of<br>
worms frequently stimulates excessive secretions of fluid, producing<br>
Dropsy.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: The abdomen is abnormally increased in size, flanks are gaunt,<br>
paleness of the membranes of the mouth and eyes and a general weakness.<br>
Pressure with the hand on the abdominal walls will produce a splashing,<br>
watery sound.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: The cause at first should be determined and the disease<br>
treated accordingly. If due to worms, withhold all food for twenty-four<br>
hours. Place two ounces of Oil of Turpentine in gelatin capsules and<br>
give with capsule gun. Follow this in six hours with two drams of Aloin,<br>
three drams of Ginger in gelatin capsule and give with capsule gun. Feed<br>
nourishing food as wheat bran mashes and one cup of Flaxseed meal once a<br>
day. In their drinking water place one dram of Potassium Iodide two or<br>
three times a day. See that this water is drunk and give no other until<br>
this is consumed by the animal.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
ECZEMA<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Insanitary surroundings, as warm, damp stables. Overfeeding,<br>
swills, decomposed vegetables. Applying irritating drugs to the skin.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Redness of the skin and the animal rubs itself; is usually<br>
confined to a small area at first, but eventually spreads. Considerable<br>
inflammation is present, also eruptions of the skin which discharge<br>
white, serous, sticky fluid, terminating in scabs and thickness of the<br>
skin. Sometimes suppuration or formation of pustules containing pus is<br>
present. These symptoms do not always occur in regular succession; in<br>
some cases the serums oozing from the skin will be more prominent than<br>
in others.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Determine the cause and remove it. If due to poor food,<br>
improve the quality. Also feed laxative food, as hot bran mashes,<br>
steamed rolled oats. If the bowels do not act freely, administer Aloin,<br>
two drams, and Ginger, three drams. Place in gelatin capsule and give<br>
with capsule gun, An ointment made from the following is very effective<br>
as an application in this condition: Blue Ointment, one ounce; Zinc<br>
Oxide, three ounces. Mix well and apply two or three times a day. A<br>
tonic usually has a very good effect in the treatment of this disease,<br>
and I would recommend the use of the following: Pulv. Gentian Root, four<br>
ounces; Potassium Nitrate, four ounces; Ferri Sulphate, four ounces. Mix<br>
and make into twelve capsules and give one capsule two or three times a<br>
day with capsule gun.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
ERGOT POISON<br>
<br>
(Ergotism)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Ergotism is produced by cattle eating fungoid growths which<br>
attack kernels and seeds of rye and blue grass, etc. These kernels or<br>
seeds grow dark in color and become abnormally large and curved in<br>
shape. The infected grass or hay when eaten by cattle contract the<br>
arteries, especially those of the legs, just above the feet, although<br>
all the arteries in the body are contracted to a certain extent. This<br>
disease is frequently seen in Spring and Summer.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Ergot is prescribed in cases of bleeding, because of its<br>
contracting effect upon the arteries (closing or stopping the flow of<br>
blood) where the blood supply is the weakest, as in the extremities. It<br>
is cut off and this, of course, causes the skin just above the hoofs to<br>
break or crack as though it were cut with a knife. This shuts off the<br>
entire supply of blood to the foot, which mummifies, and the lower<br>
portion becomes gangrenous and eventually sloughs off. One of the first<br>
effects of Ergot Poison in pregnant cattle is abortion, due to the blood<br>
supply to the womb being shut off by its contracting effect on the<br>
arteries. Cattle are particularly susceptible to Ergotism.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: When Ergotism is so advanced as to produce sloughing of the<br>
feet it is best to destroy the animal. If other animals are affected<br>
slightly, find out the cause and remove it. Look to the hay or pasture<br>
as the producer. Administer one-half ounce of Chloral Hydrate, two or<br>
three times a day in their drinking water or mix it with sufficient<br>
quantity of Flaxseed meal to fill an ounce gelatin capsule and give with<br>
capsule gun. If the skin is slightly broken above the foot, wash with<br>
five per cent solution of Carbolic Acid. Where the feet have become<br>
gangrenous amputation of the foot or feet is necessary, which is not<br>
advisable unless the animal is very valuable.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
FLUKE<br>
<br>
(Liver and Lungs)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: This disease is contracted by cattle grazing on marshy lands.<br>
There are two different species of Fluke that affect the liver and lungs<br>
of cattle. They are both flat, leaf-like worms. The Common Liver Fluke<br>
is about one-half inch long, while the so-called American Fluke is<br>
somewhat larger. In their life history these Flukes depend on snails as<br>
intermediate hosts. At a certain stage of development the young Flukes<br>
live on snails. They become encysted on stalks and blades of grass which<br>
are finally swallowed by grazing cattle. This disease is most frequently<br>
seen in young cattle.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: The animal shows no marked signs at first, but eventually the<br>
appetite diminishes, rumination or chewing of the cud becomes irregular,<br>
the animal becomes dull, hide-bound, hair standing, the visible mucous<br>
membranes of the mouth and eyes become pale and bloodless, the eyes<br>
discharge watery fluids oozing down the face, temperature varying from<br>
two to three degrees above normal and milk supply, if in aged cattle,<br>
remarkably reduced. In all cases there is great thirst and the animal<br>
becomes very much emaciated and refuses to eat. Swellings about the<br>
belly and breast, etc. Diarrhoea at first, alternating with<br>
constipation, but finally becomes continuous. The diseased animal<br>
succumbs to the malady in from two to six months.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Medical treatment is unsatisfactory. The disease will be<br>
prevented to a considerable extent by giving animals plenty of salt and<br>
in the marshes containing pools of water introduce or plant carp, frogs<br>
and toads into the infected tracts. These will destroy the young<br>
parasites and feed upon the snails which serve as their intermediate<br>
hosts. Or, prevent the cattle from grazing upon swampy marshes by<br>
fencing them out.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE<br>
<br>
(Infectious Aphtha--Epizootica Eczema)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: This disease is produced by a specific agent or germ, the exact<br>
nature of which is not known. It will pass through the Berkfelt filter,<br>
which is the most minute filter known to science, and is therefore known<br>
as a filterable virus. This is an eruptive fever and belongs to the<br>
class of Exanthematous diseases such as smallpox, measles, scarlet<br>
fever, etc. Every outbreak starts from some pre-existing infection. The<br>
infection is distributed by manure, pastures, barnyards, hay, drinking<br>
troughs, box-cars, ships, boats which have been previously occupied by<br>
animals affected with this disease, travel over public highways or man<br>
may carry the infection of this disease on his clothing and transmit it<br>
to healthy cattle, etc. Foot and Mouth Disease not only affects cattle<br>
but attacks a variety of animals, as the horse, sheep, goat, hog, dog,<br>
cat, also wild animals as buffalo, deer, antelope, and man himself is<br>
not immune from this disease. Children also suffer from Foot and Mouth<br>
Disease, resulting from drinking unboiled milk from infected cattle.<br>
Therefore, when purchasing cattle be very careful, as you may be buying<br>
an infections disease. Keep the newly purchased animals to themselves<br>
for two or three weeks, if possible. This will give ample time for the<br>
majority of infectious diseases to develop.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: The disease usually makes its first appearance in three to six<br>
days after being exposed, by chilling, rise of temperature, and in a day<br>
or so pustules varying in size from that of a pin head to that of a pea<br>
appear. They appear upon the inner surface of the lips, gums and upper<br>
surface of the tongue. The feet also become affected between the digits.<br>
The udder usually becomes affected, especially in milking cows. As soon<br>
as this disease becomes well established the affected animal evinces<br>
great pain when attempting to eat. The animal generally refuses food. In<br>
many instances they shut and open the mouth with a smacking sound owing<br>
to the stringy saliva flowing from the mouth. The ulcers in the mouth<br>
continue to enlarge until they attain the size of one-half to two inches<br>
in diameter. The mucous membrane covering these ulcers breaks and a<br>
watery discharge escapes. In a few days the surface of the ulcers takes<br>
on a whitish appearance. The same changes take place in the feet and the<br>
animal becomes very lame and the udder very much swollen, the ulcers<br>
discharge, etc.<br>
<br>
PREVENTION: When any of the above mentioned symptoms are noticed,<br>
non-affected animals should immediately be removed to non-affected<br>
quarters. This disease is not communicated through the atmosphere but by<br>
the animal coming into direct contact with the infection or virus; hence<br>
it is not necessary to move unaffected animals any great distance but<br>
merely to clean, sanitary quarters which have not been subjected to any<br>
possible infection from the diseased animals. It must be borne in mind<br>
that the attendant or helper cannot be too careful in the matter of his<br>
own actions and dress as the infection is easily carried through<br>
clothes, fecal matter, etc., adhering to shoes or any matter or<br>
articles, such as buckets, brushes, rubrags, blankets, etc.<br>
<br>
The existence of this disease should at once be reported to your nearest<br>
Veterinarian. He will report to the State Veterinarian of your State or<br>
to the United States Bureau of Animal Industry at Washington, D. C.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: I cannot recommend any treatment as being satisfactory or a<br>
cure, for although under some treatments the animal appears to make a<br>
good recovery, in the majority of cases the feet are disfigured and<br>
crippled, the udder permanently injured with growths, animal unfit for<br>
milking purposes, and the mouth, tongue and teeth left impaired; the<br>
mouth and tongue strictured from wounds and the teeth loosened from the<br>
gums. Furthermore, should an animal make apparent recovery, it is not<br>
immune from a recurrence of the disease. In treating the disease, there<br>
is not only danger of spreading the disease to other animals, but to<br>
man. The flesh or milk from animals apparently cured should never be<br>
used unless first examined by a qualified Veterinarian.<br>
<br>
Without question, all animals showing severe symptoms as above described<br>
should be at once slaughtered and buried six feet or deeper, covering<br>
carcass with Quicklime and then promptly filling grave, according to the<br>
Government regulations, which should be followed explicitly. Be careful<br>
to disinfect scene of slaughter, as bloodstains, etc. The United States<br>
Bureau of Animal Industry regulates the disinfectants to be used and the<br>
strength thereof, and as these are subject to change from time to time,<br>
I must refer you in this matter to the proper Government authorities.<br>
<br>
MEDICAL TREATMENT: If permitted by Government authorities, I would<br>
suggest the following treatment as being beneficial: In mild attacks of<br>
Foot and Mouth Disease benefits may be derived by cleanliness and the<br>
applications of antiseptics as placing Boracic Acid, one dram; Potassium<br>
Chlorate, two drams, in a bucket of water, compelling the animal to<br>
drink it. Repeat this dose two or three times a day. Also compel the<br>
animals to stand in tubs or troughs containing a one in one thousandth<br>
solution of Bichloride of Mercury for at least five minutes, twice<br>
daily. When other parts of the body become affected, as the cow's udder,<br>
apply Carbolated Vaseline twice daily. This treatment should be<br>
continued until all ulcers have ceased to discharge. Always keep in mind<br>
that this disease is contagious and is transmitted to other animals, as<br>
well as to man. For disinfecting corrals, barns, clothing, hands and<br>
anything which the diseased animal might come in contact with, I would<br>
recommend Coal Tar products, diluted one part to fifty parts warm water.<br>
Spray, sprinkle or scrub.<br>

<br>
FOOT ROT<br>
<br>
(Foul in Foot)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Due to filth or from hard substances accumulating between the two<br>
digits, producing irritation and inflammation and suppuration.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Lameness. On examination the foot is swollen, hot and painful<br>
to the touch. When the case is of long standing, suppuration occurs and<br>
pus will ooze from between the digits, and is very offensive in smell.<br>
This condition causes the digits to slough off, if no attempt is made to<br>
relieve it.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Cleanliness. Where there is considerable inflammation<br>
present, apply Hot Bran or Flaxseed poultices. Keep clean and treat as<br>
an ordinary wound. The following prescription will be found very<br>
effective in Foot Rot: Oil of Origanum, four ounces; Oil of Pisis, four<br>
ounces; Oil of Turpentine, four ounces. Saturate oakum or cotton with<br>
the above liniment placing between the digits and bandage. Feed laxative<br>
food, as hot wheat bran mashes and vegetables.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
FOUNDER<br>
<br>
(Laminitis)<br>
<br>
Inflammation of the internal, sensitive structure of the foot.<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Overfeeding, overheating, driving on rough, stony soil. Cattle<br>
confined to stand on hard floors without exercise frequently suffer from<br>
Founder.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: The animals lie down a great part of the time. Feet hot and<br>
tender and if made to walk they do so with great difficulty. One or all<br>
four feet may become affected, although it is more frequently found in<br>
the front feet. The temperature is somewhat elevated, varying from 104<br>
to 106 degrees F., breathing very rapid, appetite fairly good and there<br>
will be great thirst. Founder in cows reduces the milk secretion, owing<br>
to the great fever that is present.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Apply cold packs to the feet, ice packs preferred. If the<br>
animal can be made to stand in a stream of water having a soft bottom,<br>
it, perhaps, is the best method of cooling out the feet. Give a physic<br>
of Aloin, three drams; Pulv. Gentian Root, two drams. Place in a gelatin<br>
capsule and give with capsule gun. To their drinking water add two or<br>
three drams of Potassi Nitrate three or four times daily. Animals<br>
suffering with Founder should be provided with soft ground to stand on,<br>
as their feet will be tender and subject to the chronic form of the<br>
disease.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
GARGET<br>
<br>
(Congestion of the Udder)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Very common in heavy milkers before or just after calving when<br>
the bag is very much enlarged and very sensitive; exposure to chilling<br>
or standing in drafts or even neglected for too long a time in milking.<br>
Injuries may also cause Garget.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: The bag is very much enlarged, showing signs of inflammation.<br>
The swelling extends well forward following the milk veins. The cow has<br>
great difficulty in walking due to sensitiveness of the bag. When milked<br>
for two or three days the swelling disappears after the secretion is<br>
fully established, but as a rule is tinged with blood. Sometimes small<br>
clots of milk or cheese-like particles are ejected with the milk.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Give a physic consisting of Aloin, two drams; Pulv. Ginger,<br>
three drams. Place in gelatin capsule and give with capsule gun:<br>
Hyposulphite of Soda, sixteen ounces; Nitrate of Potassi, four ounces.<br>
Mix and make into sixteen powders. Give one powder three times a day in<br>
drinking water or place in gelatin capsule and give with capsule gun.<br>
Also dissolve Bichloride of Mercury, two grains; Boracic Acid, two<br>
drams, in one quart of boiling hot water. When this solution cools to<br>
about blood temperature, after stripping all milk fluid or pus from the<br>
affected teat or teats, inject with an ordinary bulb injection syringe<br>
after placing a teat tube into the end from which the air escapes when<br>
the bulb is pressed. Now, place the end of the syringe retaining the<br>
teat tube in the affected teat, the other end place in a bottle or<br>
vessel containing the solution and gently press the bulb and inject<br>
about a pint of the solution in each affected quarter. Leave the<br>
solution in the teat for only fifteen to twenty minutes and milk out<br>
thoroughly. Repeat this treatment two or three times a day.<br>
<br>
For an external application the following ointment has given remarkably<br>
good results: Blue Ointment and Zinc Ointment, equal parts. Mix well and<br>
apply two or three times daily.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
HARD MILKERS<br>
<br>
CAUSE: A thickness or contraction of the mucous membranes lining the<br>
teat or growths inside the teat.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: All antiseptic precautions should be carried out in this<br>
operation, as boiling the instruments and then covering them with<br>
Carbolated Vaseline. Then with a hidden bistoury or a knife concealed in<br>
a tube, force upward into the teat, then press out the little blade and<br>
draw the instrument down the teat, making about four incisions equal<br>
distance apart around the inner surface of the teat. The use of<br>
self-retaining teat dilators prevents the contraction of the cut<br>
surface, permitting them to remain in the teat for two weeks, removing<br>
them only when the milk is being stripped from the teat. Always place<br>
them in boiling water and cover with Carbolated Vaseline before<br>
inserting.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
HOLLOW HORN<br>
<br>
Horns of the cattle tribe are normally hollow, although a core extends<br>
well into the horn. This, however, is merely a prolongation of a porous<br>
bone of the head which affords a point for the horns' attachment,<br>
consequently when a cow is sick and the temperature is elevated, the<br>
horns are naturally hot, it being the symptom of a disease and not a<br>
disease of itself, and which should be treated under its special<br>
heading.<br>
<br>
The supposed disease "Hollow Horn" once upon a time was treated by<br>
boring a hole into the horn with a small gimlet and pouring Turpentine<br>
into the opening. This treatment is useless and harmful. It produces<br>
inflammation of the frontal sinuses of the head and chances are death of<br>
the animal will follow as a result of the treatment and not of the<br>
disease.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
INDIGESTION<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Animals with a voracious appetite will overload their stomachs<br>
with food that is hard to digest or is decomposed, causing the organs of<br>
assimilation to become weakened, sluggish and incapable of doing their<br>
proper work.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: The animal ceases to ruminate (chew its cud); stands quietly,<br>
hair rough, nose dry, temperature elevated one to two degrees, breathing<br>
usually faster than normal with slight grunts at each expiration of air<br>
from the lungs. The secretions of milk are suddenly diminished. If the<br>
hand is placed against the left side and quickly removed, a marked<br>
depression or pit will remain, which shows that the paunch is full of<br>
undigested food. Bloating is also frequently accompanied by indigestion.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Administer Aloin, three drams; Ginger, three drams. Place in<br>
capsule and give with capsule gun. Permit the animal to drink all the<br>
water possible. If bloating is present give two-ounce capsules filled<br>
with Turpentine with capsule gun. A tonic is quite necessary in this<br>
condition, and the following I am sure will be followed by good results<br>
if the case is not of too long a standing: Sodium Bicarbonate, eight<br>
ounces; Pulv. Nux Vomica, four ounces; Pulv. Gentian Root, four ounces;<br>
Pulv. Ginger, four ounces. Place two tablespoonfuls in gelatin capsule<br>
and give with capsule gun every six hours. Very good results are also<br>
obtained from rectal injections of soap and warm water. Feed good<br>
nourishing food sparingly, compelling the animal to exercise, etc.<br>

INFLAMMATION OF THE BAG<br>
<br>
(Simple Mammitis)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Injuries, as blows, kicks, etc.; lying on cold, rough ground or<br>
floor, standing in drafts, sudden change of weather. Derangement of the<br>
system is likely to affect the udder; poorly milked or stripped cows are<br>
often victims of Mammitis. Infections in the teat from inserting dirty<br>
instruments, as using a bicycle pump for the treatment of Milk Fever.<br>
Cows with a retained afterbirth are likely to infect the udder by<br>
switching their tail. This condition is very common in heavy milkers<br>
following calving.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: The animal chills, hair stands, temperature elevated from one<br>
to three degrees above normal; ears, horns and legs cold, which may<br>
suddenly become very hot; pulse rapid, breathing hurried, bag hard and<br>
swollen and very tender on pressure. When attempts are made to milk, a<br>
watery substance comes away, almost colorless at first, but later<br>
becomes tinged with blood and pus and has a fetid odor. The cow's muzzle<br>
is dry, appetite poor, but great thirst exists. This condition may<br>
affect one or more quarters of the udder. Abscesses may form and the<br>
udder break and a thick yellowish pus oozes out or the milk glands may<br>
solidify and cause hard, lumpy growths in the udder.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Prevention. If an animal is once slightly affected with<br>
inflammation of the bag, it is likely to develop a bad case of Mammitis<br>
from the slightest injury or exposure as stated above, which depreciates<br>
a cow considerably as a milk producer, especially on the market. Great<br>
care should be exercised when purchasing a cow for milking purposes. See<br>
that the teats and udder are sound, free from lumps, etc.<br>
<br>
MEDICAL TREATMENT: Hyposulphite of Soda, sixteen ounces; Nitrate of<br>
Potassi, four ounces. Mix and make into sixteen powders. Give one powder<br>
three times a day in drinking water or place in a gelatin capsule and<br>
give with a capsule gun. Also, dissolve Bichloride of Mercury, two<br>
grains; Boracic Acid, two drams, in one quart of boiling hot water. When<br>
this solution cools to about blood temperature, after stripping all milk<br>
fluid or pus from the affected teat or teats, inject with an ordinary<br>
bulb injection syringe after placing a teat tube into the end from which<br>
the air escapes when the bulb is pressed. Now, place this end of the<br>
syringe retaining the teat tube in the affected teat; the other end<br>
place in a bottle or vessel containing the solution and gently press the<br>
bulb and inject about a pint of the solution into each affected quarter.<br>
Leave the solution in the teat for only fifteen to twenty minutes and<br>
milk out thoroughly. Repeat this treatment two or three times a day.<br>
<br>
For an external application, the following ointment has given remarkably<br>
good results: Blue Ointment, two ounces; Lard, two ounces. Mix well and<br>
apply twice daily.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
INFLAMMATION OF THE EYE<br>
<br>
(Conjunctivitis)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Injuries; irritating gases, from an animal standing in dark and<br>
poorly ventilated stables or foreign bodies in the eye, as chaff, etc.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: A constant flow of tears from the eye running down the<br>
animal's face, which are due to the inflammation of the lining membranes<br>
of the eye. The eye is partially or completely closed.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: If due to a foreign body, remove it. In order to accomplish<br>
this, the animal must be placed in a stanchion, the head twisted and the<br>
eyelid turned back. Do not use burned alum as this will only make the<br>
condition worse. Use Boracic Acid, thirty grains; distilled water, one<br>
ounce. Apply to the eye three or four times daily, using an ordinary<br>
eye-dropper.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
INFLAMMATION OF THE HEART SACK<br>
<br>
(Pericarditis)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Cattle being ruminants, therefore, not masticating their food<br>
finely before swallowing, consequently foreign bodies, such as nails,<br>
wire, etc., are picked up with the food and taken into the rumen or<br>
paunch. These sharp objects penetrate the walls of the paunch, rumen or<br>
first stomach and pierce the membrane or sack surrounding the heart,<br>
which produces an inflammation of the heart sack, or Pericarditis.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Symptoms develop very slowly or indications of indigestion<br>
will be present as the appetite is variable, temperature elevated,<br>
breathing labored, the animal avoids walking down hill as it causes pain<br>
from the stomach and intestines pressing the lungs against the heart.<br>
The symptoms, however, are so slight that they may easily escape the<br>
notice of a casual observer. The animal eventually becomes poor,<br>
emaciated and dies. If you open the heart sack, it will be found full of<br>
watery pus.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Unsuccessful, as this disease is seldom diagnosed correctly,<br>
and if it is an operation is necessary and this does not prove<br>
successful in the majority of cases.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
INFLAMMATION OF THE KIDNEYS<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Injuries in the region of the kidneys, exposure to cold weather,<br>
especially in cows soon after calving. Eating poisonous plants,<br>
decomposed food or drinking stagnant water, irritating medicines given<br>
ignorantly of their bad effects are frequently followed by inflammation<br>
of the kidneys.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: The attack will first be noticed by slight shivering or<br>
chilling followed by an increased temperature, breathing increased. The<br>
animal attempts to urinate frequently and the amount passed is small and<br>
of a dark amber color and may be flaked with blood. There will be<br>
stiffness and straddling of the hind legs which is always present during<br>
urinary disorders. There may be slight swelling and tenderness over the<br>
kidneys. As the disease progresses the animal grows weak and finally<br>
dies if prompt relief is not afforded. Fortunately this disease is not<br>
common among cattle.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Clothe the animal if the weather is cold. Mild physics are<br>
beneficial, as Aloin, one and one-half drams; Ginger, two drams; Nux<br>
Vomica, two drams, placed in a gelatin capsule and given with capsule<br>
gun. Also, the following, which is very soothing to the urinary tract:<br>
Potassium Acetate, Potassium Bromide, each four ounces, made into<br>
sixteen powders. Give one powder every four hours in their drinking<br>
water. Feed nitrogenous food as hot wheat bran mashes, steamed rolled<br>
oats, and see that the animal has pure water to drink.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
INFLAMMATION OF THE PENIS<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Injuries received from snags, walking through the underbrush,<br>
jumping fences, etc.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Arched back, swelling of the sheath and in some cases a<br>
discharge. It may be serious enough to affect the appetite and cause<br>
fever.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Wash out the sheath two or three times daily with a three per<br>
cent solution of Boracic Acid. If the inflammation extends pretty well<br>
back in the sheath, it is advisable to inject this solution with a<br>
syringe, carefully, as far back as possible. Withdraw the syringe,<br>
holding the opening of the sheath so as to retain the solution for a few<br>
minutes before allowing it to escape.<br>
<br>
Feed laxative food and supply the animal with fresh water to drink. If<br>
there is considerable fever, administer Potassium Nitrate, Pulv. Nux<br>
Vomica, each two ounces. Make into eight capsules and give one capsule<br>
two or three times a day.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
INFLAMMATION OF THE WOMB<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Injuries, as bruises, laceration, sustained during calving,<br>
especially where the cow is assisted with instruments or hands that are<br>
not thoroughly aseptic, an animal retaining the afterbirth which<br>
undergoes putrefaction, and consequently sets up an inflammation of the<br>
womb, or perhaps the animal may become infected during the act of<br>
removing the afterbirth if the operator is neglectful about washing his<br>
hands or washing the womb out thoroughly.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: The animal will chill, the temperature elevated two or three<br>
degrees, the back will be arched, stiffness of the hind parts, legs,<br>
ears and horns cold, nose hot and dry, grinding of the teeth, the cow<br>
usually remains standing, ceases to chew her cud, the secretions of milk<br>
will be markedly reduced and a day or so after the symptoms appear,<br>
there will be a discharge from the womb of a reddish lumpy nature. This<br>
becomes thick and yellow containing small particles of flesh, showing<br>
that the inner lining of the womb is sloughing. This discharge is very<br>
offensive in odor. A cow in this condition requires the best of care or<br>
she will die as the decomposed substance in the womb may be absorbed<br>
into the circulation and produce Pyemia or Septicemia (Blood Poison).<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Give Aloin, two drams; Pulv. Ginger, three drams, place in a<br>
gelatin capsule and give with capsule gun. Flush out the womb thoroughly<br>
with a tablespoonful of Carbolic Acid to one gallon of water two or<br>
three times a day. A convenient instrument for flushing out the womb can<br>
be made from an ordinary funnel and a clean hose about four feet long.<br>
This answers the purpose of an injection syringe very well. In their<br>
drinking water add the following: Hyposulphite of Soda, sixteen ounces;<br>
Potassium Iodide, two ounces. Make into sixteen powders and give one<br>
powder two or three times a day.<br>
<br>
In addition to the above treatment it is necessary to give alteratives<br>
and bitter tonics to build up the condition of the animal as soon as<br>
possible. The following will be found very effective: Pulv. Gentian<br>
Root, four ounces; Pulv. Ferri Sulphate, four ounces; Nitrate of Potash,<br>
four ounces. Mix and make into sixteen powders and give one powder three<br>
times a day. Place in a gelatin capsule and administer with a capsule<br>
gun.<br>
<br>
My reasons for giving animals medicine in capsules are:<br>
<br>
1. There is no danger of liquids, as in drenching, escaping into the<br>
lungs.<br>
<br>
2. Any drug having any beneficial effects as a tonic is very bitter,<br>
consequently the only way the animal will take it is by placing in<br>
capsule.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
JOINT ILL, NAVEL ILL<br>
<br>
(Umbilical Pyemia and Septicemia)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: This disease is produced by various germs entering the navel cord<br>
of newly born calves when dropped, the navel being freshly severed and<br>
its coming in contact with filth and manure where germs are numerous,<br>
consequently germs adhere and enter the blood stream. Calf Scours as a<br>
rule is associated with this disease.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Swelling of the joints which are very hot and painful on<br>
pressure, and when the calf is made to move it walks stiffly and slowly,<br>
does not care to nurse its mother or take any food, temperature elevated<br>
from 105 to 108 degrees F., breathing hurried, pulse very weak and<br>
quick. There will be an offensive discharge from the navel cord of a<br>
yellowish color and swollen joints finally break and also discharge a<br>
thick yellow pus. The calf becomes emaciated and finally dies from<br>
exhaustion.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Prevention. Provide clean surroundings for cows when calving,<br>
and in addition to this have a one in one-thousandth solution of<br>
Bichloride of Mercury on hand. Wash the navel well in the solution once<br>
a day until the cord is thoroughly dried.<br>
<br>
MEDICAL TREATMENT: Unsuccessful. Sometimes the calf recovers, but at<br>
best the calf is badly stunted and is very seldom worth keeping.<br>
However, the following method of treatment has been followed with fairly<br>
good results: Wash the navel cord well in a one-thousandth solution of<br>
Bichloride of Mercury two or three times a day and give Zinc<br>
Sulphocarbolates, one-fourth grain; Potassi Iodide, five grains, in a<br>
little water or milk three or four times a day. Feed them three or four<br>
eggs a day, molasses, fresh milk. This will keep up the strength and<br>
vitality and a good recovery may follow, although it is an exception and<br>
not a rule.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
LACERATION OF THE EYELID<br>
<br>
CAUSE: An eyelid may be torn on the manger, rubbing post or barb wire<br>
fence, etc.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Wash the lacerated portions of the eye thoroughly with a five<br>
per cent solution of Carbolic Acid. It may be necessary to take a few<br>
stitches in the wound or the torn edges may be cut off with a pair of<br>
sharp scissors. If stitches have been taken, they should be removed<br>
after the parts have united and the eye kept clean. A very convenient<br>
application for the eye in this condition is Boracic Acid, one dram;<br>
Distilled Water, four ounces. Apply liberally to the eye.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
LEECHES<br>
<br>
(Blood Suckers)<br>
<br>
Leeches which suck blood of cattle are sometimes taken up by the animals<br>
when drinking water from ponds, etc. The leeches attach themselves to<br>
the inner surface of the mouth or nose, and sometimes reach the upper<br>
part of windpipe or the gullet. Bleeding at the mouth or nose may be<br>
noticed, the membranes where the leeches attach themselves become<br>
congested and swollen, and as a result of the loss of blood anemic<br>
condition follows.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: If the leeches can be reached, they are easily destroyed by<br>
cutting them in two with a pair of scissors or they may be removed with<br>
a pair of forceps or with the fingers after wrapping a piece of cloth<br>
around them so as to prevent slipping.<br>
<br>
Steam from boiling hot water containing Pine Tar or Oil of Turpentine<br>
may cause leeches to release their hold if they cannot be removed by<br>
other means. In ponds where leeches are numerous, eels should be<br>
introduced as they feed upon blood suckers of this species.<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
LUMPY JAW<br>
<br>
(Wooden Tongue, Big Head, Actinomycosis)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: The Ray Fungus. This organism which occurs in the tissues in the<br>
form of russets is directly transmitted from one animal to another. It<br>
seems apparent that the fungus is conveyed into the tissues of the mouth<br>
by various food stuff through slight wounds of the mucous membranes of<br>
the mouth or an animal that has decayed teeth or during the shedding of<br>
milk teeth. The Ray Fungus is found naturally vegetated or clinging on<br>
the awns of barley, the spears of oats and on other grains. Quantities<br>
of fungi have been found between the vegetable fibers of barley which<br>
had penetrated the gums of cattle and on the awns of grain imbedded in<br>
their tongues.<br>
<br>
Lumpy Jaw can also be transmitted by coming in contact with or eating<br>
food over which lumpy jawed cattle have slobbered. A healthy animal<br>
eating such food with very slight bruises or abrasions of the mouth will<br>
contract the disease very readily. This disease is misleading as other<br>
organs are affected with the Ray Fungi or the Bacillus of Actinomycosis,<br>
as the lungs and even the digestive organs have been found to be<br>
affected with this disease.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: External symptoms or signs are the only means by which to<br>
ascertain the disease. Its exact location is on the lower jaw bone near<br>
its angle. It may also affect the upper jaw, but this is an exception<br>
and not a rule. Internally it may affect the tongue, mouth, throat or<br>
lungs, but rarely the intestines. This enlargement continues to grow<br>
until it reaches the size of that of a man's head, breaks and discharges<br>
pus. The animal becomes poor and emaciated, the hair takes on a dull,<br>
roughened appearance and in many cases it is very difficult for it to<br>
eat, especially where the disease separates the gums and bone from the<br>
teeth and causes them to become very loose or to drop out. The animal in<br>
the latter stages of this disease generally dies from starvation.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Successful in its first stages. Soft, nitrogenous food should<br>
be fed, such as wheat bran mashes, steamed rolled oats or barley, hay<br>
dampened with clean water, so as to make it pliable. Hay containing<br>
woody matter as stems, etc., should not be fed to an animal affected<br>
with Lumpy Jaw as it tends to aggravate the disease. Internally in their<br>
drinking water give two drams of Potassium Iodide morning and night.<br>
This treatment, however, should be omitted when the animal's skin<br>
becomes scaly or when an excessive watery discharge flows from the eyes.<br>
On the outer surface over the enlargement apply the following ointment:<br>
Red Iodide of Mercury, four drams; Lard, two ounces. Mix well and rub in<br>
briskly for twenty minutes every five or six days for three weeks. The<br>
cure can generally be ascertained by the animal gaining in flesh,<br>
although the lump may remain. Where Lumpy Jaw is of long standing so as<br>
to impair the use of the animal's tongue or teeth, it is best to destroy<br>
the animal, as this lessens the possibilities of infecting healthy<br>
animals.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
LUNG FEVER<br>
<br>
(Pneumonia)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Generally follows congestion of the lungs. It may be due to<br>
parasitic organisms or exposure to cold, drafts when warm after being<br>
driven, etc. Drenching perhaps is the most common cause as it is very<br>
difficult for a cow to swallow when the head is elevated; inhaling<br>
smoke, gases, etc., also tend to produce pneumonia.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Chilling or shivering, temperature elevated to 105 or 106<br>
degrees F., nose hot and dry, horns and legs cold. Pulse rapid though<br>
strong, breathing fast and the appetite very good in some cases. The<br>
animal urinates small quantities of urine but often, of a dark amber<br>
color. A discharge from the nose follows, also a cough. If the ear is<br>
placed back of the fore leg, a dry crackling sound can be heard<br>
something on the order of rubbing hair between the fingers.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Place the animal in a dry, well lighted and ventilated<br>
stable, but avoid drafts. Give Pulv. Iodide of Ammonia, one ounce; Pulv.<br>
Potassium Nitrate, four ounces; Pulv. Nux Vomica, four ounces; Pulv.<br>
Capsicum, one ounce; Quinine, one ounce. Mix well and make into<br>
thirty-two powders. Place one powder in gelatin capsule and administer<br>
every three or four hours with capsule gun. Supply the animal with fresh<br>
water at all times. Feed laxative food as hot wheat bran mashes or<br>
steamed rolled oats. Also feed vegetables, such as potatoes, apples,<br>
carrots and kale. It is also advisable to apply the following over the<br>
region of the lungs just back of the fore legs: Aqua Ammonia Fort., four<br>
ounces; Oil of Turpentine, four ounces; Raw Linseed Oil, six ounces. Mix<br>
and shake well and apply two or three times daily. It is also advisable<br>
to hand rub the legs and bandage them with woolen cloths. If the above<br>
treatment is properly carried out, the animal will make a complete<br>
recovery in a week or ten days.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
LOSS OF CUD<br>
<br>
CAUSE: This condition cannot always be traced to a definite cause, as it<br>
is a symptom of all diseases where the process of rumination is<br>
interfered with. The only method by which a cow will again chew her cud<br>
is to restore her back to health by the proper medical treatment.<br>
Artificial cuds are of no value and frequently are a detriment to the<br>
animal. Other symptoms aside from those of the animal not chewing cud<br>
will always make their appearance, as constipation, diarrhoea, elevation<br>
of the temperature, etc. The animal should be thoroughly examined and<br>
the disease treated under its special heading.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
MANGE<br>
<br>
(Scabies)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: There are four different parasites which produce Mange or Scabies<br>
in cattle. However, three of these parasites are rarely seen. The<br>
Symbotis Communis is the parasite commonly seen in American cattle.<br>
These parasites multiply very rapidly and are conveyed from diseased<br>
animals to healthy ones by their bodies coming in contact with one<br>
another and by healthy animals rubbing against fences, walls, posts,<br>
etc., where mangy cattle have previously rubbed.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Scabs, loss of hair, intense itching, the animals are<br>
constantly rubbing or licking themselves. The parts showing the first<br>
signs of Mange are those about the croup, or the root of the tail, the<br>
neck and withers, but as the disease progresses and no attempts are<br>
offered for its eradication, it finally spreads and covers the entire<br>
body. The scabs become ulcerated, the animal becomes weakened, emaciated<br>
and eventually dies.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Dipping in wood or concrete vats is the most satisfactory<br>
method of treating Mange. The regular lime and sulphur dip as<br>
recommended by the United States Bureau of Animal Industry is<br>
inexpensive and effective.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
MEASLY BEEF<br>
<br>
Is produced by a larva of common tapeworm of man. These small tapeworm<br>
cysts (taenia saginata) are about the size of a pea and found in the<br>
flesh of cattle, which become infected by eating food or drinking water<br>
which has been contaminated by the feces of persons harboring adult<br>
tapeworms. Then again, the person becomes infected by eating raw or rare<br>
flesh of cattle infected with the larva stage of Measly Beef. Great care<br>
should be exercised to prevent cattle from becoming infected with this<br>
parasite. Persons' feces should not be placed where it will infect food<br>
or drinking water that is consumed by cattle.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
MILK FEVER<br>
<br>
(Parturient Apoplexy)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Certain conditions predispose cows to Milk Fever, as being heavy<br>
milk producers, cows having enormous digestive power and being heavily<br>
fed on nitrogenous food naturally are in a good condition, consequently<br>
at the time of calving, or shortly after, they are likely to develop a<br>
case of Milk Fever, It is more common during summer months, although<br>
this condition may develop at any time of the year in the type of cow<br>
described above.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: At or a few days after calving, the cow is noticed hanging<br>
back in the stall, dull, languid, with an unsteady movement of the hind<br>
legs. If the cow is made to walk, she steps unsteadily or staggers, pays<br>
no attention to her calf; she finally becomes so paralyzed that she<br>
falls and is unable to rise. The pupils of the eyes are dilated and the<br>
membranes reddened or congested with blood. The cow may lie on her<br>
breast or flat on her side, but most likely upon her breast and her head<br>
turned in the region of the flank. She apparently is sound asleep. If<br>
the eyeball is touched with the fingers she does not close the eye, nor<br>
will she evince any pain when being pricked with a pin on any part of<br>
the body. The nose is dry, the temperature is below normal in most<br>
cases. Just how the name of this disease started by the name of "Milk<br>
Fever" I cannot understand.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: When the above signs are noticed, whether the cow is standing<br>
or lying down in a paralyzed condition, obtain an ordinary bulb<br>
injection syringe; insert a tube in the end from which the air escapes.<br>
After washing both syringe and teat tube in a five per cent solution of<br>
Carbolic Acid, milk or strip out all the milk possible from the bag,<br>
then insert the teat tube that is connected to the syringe in each teat,<br>
filling them well with air, and repeat this treatment every hour until<br>
the cow stops staggering, or if lying down, stands on her feet. It is<br>
necessary to strip the milk from the bag before giving an injection of<br>
air. If the cow is lying flat on her side, prop her up by placing bags<br>
of hay or straw against her side, also make her as comfortable as<br>
possible. If lying in the hot sun, provide shade by placing a canopy<br>
over her made from burlap; if the weather is chilly, blanket; if flies<br>
annoy her, use some fly repellant.<br>
<br>
This disease is satisfactorily treated. Where ninety per cent of the<br>
cows died at one time, ninety per cent can be saved by the above<br>
treatment. It is a custom with some people to use an ordinary bicycle<br>
pump for treatment of Milk Fever. This should not be practiced, as there<br>
is great danger of infecting the bag and producing serious<br>
complications.<br>
<br>
MEDICAL OR AFTER TREATMENT: Never drench a cow. Give a physic consisting<br>
of Aloin, two drams; Ginger, three drams. Place in a gelatin capsule and<br>
give with a capsule gun. Also, give tonics as Pulv. Gentian Root, two<br>
ounces; Pulv. Capsicum, one ounce; Pulv. Nux Vomica, two ounces. Mix and<br>
place into eight gelatin capsules. Give one capsule every eight hours.<br>
This tonic is quite necessary, as it stimulates their appetite, braces<br>
up their nervous system and prevents any complications that might<br>
otherwise follow.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
PARALYSIS<br>
<br>
(Congestion of the Brain or Spinal Cord)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: May be due to a morbid condition of the brain or spinal cord,<br>
concussion of the spinal cord, fractures of the bones of the spinal<br>
column, or violent shocks or jars of the brain, or pressure due to<br>
fractures of the skull, or dilated or ruptured blood vessels. Paralysis<br>
also occurs in poorly fed, weak cows when exposed to cold or wet weather<br>
during the latter stages of pregnancy. Sometimes the back portion of the<br>
bowels (the rectum) becomes paralyzed so as to interfere with the<br>
expulsion of the feces which becomes dry and more or less impacted. This<br>
condition may also occur in connection with Ergot, Forage or Lead<br>
Poisoning, Milk Fever or Parturient Apoplexy.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Appear very suddenly. The animal is unable to stand, lies<br>
quietly and groans occasionally. Constipation generally accompanies this<br>
condition. Sometimes great pain is present, especially if due to<br>
fracture or pressure, as above mentioned.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: If just due to weakness; exposure to cold, wet weather; cows<br>
prior to calving; slight injuries or mild effect of poisons, it is<br>
successfully treated by placing the animal in a comfortable, well<br>
lighted stall, omitting drafts, feeding nourishing food, as warm wheat<br>
bran mashes, steamed rolled oats or barley and linseed meal; tea to<br>
drink prepared as follows: Pour one quart of boiling water on one-half<br>
pint of Pure Flaxseed, allowing it to cool, and compel the animal to<br>
drink it. Repeat this once or twice daily, especially if the animal is<br>
pregnant. A physic consisting of Aloin, two drams; Ginger, two drams;<br>
prepared in capsule and given with a capsule gun is very effective, but<br>
this, however, should not be administered to heavily pregnant cows.<br>
Endeavor to move their bowels by careful feeding of laxative food and<br>
rectal injections of soap and water. Nerve stimulants are necessary and<br>
I have derived good results from the following: Pulv. Nux Vomica, four<br>
ounces; Pulv. Ginger, four ounces; Pulv. Gentian Root, four ounces. Make<br>
into sixteen capsules and give one capsule every four or six hours. Also<br>
apply powdered mustard, moistened with a sufficient quantity of water to<br>
make a paste, and rub over the full length of the spine about eight<br>
inches in width. This should be covered with paper which will adhere<br>
readily to the mustard and water. This application can be repeated every<br>
twenty-four hours until satisfactory results have been obtained.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
RED WATER<br>
<br>
(Hematuria)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Marshy pastures, water from rich decomposed soil. Vegetation also<br>
has a tendency to produce it as cattle eating green shoots from oak,<br>
ash, hellebore, hazel and other resinous plants, etc.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Bloody urine containing no blood clots. This condition is not<br>
noticed as a general rule until the cow loses flesh and the production<br>
of milk is considerably decreased. One particular symptom of this<br>
disease is the milk being exceptionally foamy and perhaps tinged with<br>
blood. If the disease is left to run its course, the cow will become<br>
emaciated and eventually dies.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Find out the cause and remove it if possible. See that the<br>
water supply is clean, feed nitrogenous food, as wheat bran mashes or<br>
steamed rolled oats. Do not permit the animal to eat resinous plants as<br>
stated above.<br>
<br>
Administer Pulv. Gentian Root, four ounces; Pulv. Nux Vomica, four<br>
ounces; Pulv. Ferri Sulphate, four ounces. Mix and make into sixteen<br>
capsules and give one capsule two or three times a day with capsule gun.<br>
If the animal is constipated, give two drams of Aloin, three drams of<br>
Ginger. Place in capsule and give with capsule gun.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
RETAINED AFTERBIRTH<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Retained afterbirth may follow normal or abnormal calving where<br>
there has been more or less inflammation of the womb prior to giving<br>
birth, which causes the afterbirth to adhere firmly to its attachments.<br>
Cows in poor condition fed on poor food during cold weather are very<br>
susceptible to this accident; also very common in aged cows.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Very easily detected by portions of the membranes (afterbirth)<br>
protruding from the Womb or Vulva, which becomes decomposed very shortly<br>
and offensive in odor. This accident is very serious when absorption is<br>
produced, ill health, drying up of the milk in addition to producing<br>
inflammation of the womb, Whites, etc. It may produce blood-poisoning<br>
and chances are you will lose your animal.<br>
<br>
PREVENTION: Very important. Feed the cow on food that is easily digested<br>
and supply her with fresh water to drink that is not too cold. Flaxseed<br>
Tea is very beneficial if given a day or so prior to calving and is<br>
prepared by pouring a quart of boiling hot water on one-half pint of<br>
Flaxseed, permitting it to cool of its own accord. Then compel the<br>
animal to drink it. This appears to have a very good effect on<br>
separating the afterbirth from the mushroom-like bodies of the womb to<br>
which it is attached.<br>
<br>
MEDICAL TREATMENT: The afterbirth should not be pulled away by force, as<br>
it may tear, leaving small portions unremoved that perhaps would result<br>
in Inflammation of the Womb or Whites. To remove the afterbirth insert<br>
the hand and carefully detach it from its attachments, being very<br>
careful that the cotyledons are not torn off. After this has been<br>
carefully removed, wash out the womb with Carbolic Acid solution about<br>
two and one-half per cent. An instrument can be made for this purpose<br>
very easily from a clean piece of hose about four feet long and an<br>
ordinary funnel. Sometimes it is necessary to give physics, as Aloin,<br>
two drams; Ginger, two drams. Place in a gelatin capsule and give with<br>
capsule gun.<br>
<br>
In addition to the above, stimulants are also advisable such as powdered<br>
Nux Vomica, powdered Capsicum, powdered Ginger, powdered Nitrate of<br>
Potash, equal parts four ounces. Make twenty-four capsules and give one<br>
capsule three times a day.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
RHEUMATISM<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Exposure, especially when the animal is permitted to lie on cold<br>
damp soils or floors. Another common cause is an animal exposed to cold<br>
drafts after perspiring or weakened after severe physical exercise.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Stiffness when walking, variable appetite, constipation, hair<br>
unthrifty looking. Passage of urine is scant and of an amber color,<br>
usually slight elevation in temperature and the animal lies down a great<br>
part of the time. There are two forms of rheumatism--muscular and<br>
articular. The former affects the muscles of the body, while the latter<br>
affects the joints. There will be swellings that are tender on pressure,<br>
which may shift to different parts of the body.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Place the animal in warm dry quarters with a sufficient<br>
quantity of clean bedding. Feed foods that are easily digested, as wheat<br>
bran mashes and steamed rolled oats and vegetables. Keep pure, cold<br>
water within the animal's reach at all times. The following prescription<br>
has been found very effective in the treatment of this disease: Sodium<br>
Salicylate, six ounces; Nux Vomica, two ounces; Pulv. Gentian Root, two<br>
ounces; Nitrate of Potash, two ounces. Mix and make into sixteen<br>
capsules and give one capsule three times daily with capsule gun. If the<br>
bowels are constipated give Aloin, two drams; Ginger, three drams. Place<br>
in capsule and give with capsule gun. When the joints or muscles become<br>
swollen and inflamed, the following liniment will be found very<br>
effective in reducing the swellings: Aqua Ammonia Fort., two ounces; Oil<br>
of Turpentine, three ounces; Sweet Oil, six ounces. Mix and apply by<br>
rubbing in well two or three times a day.<br>

<br>
RINGWORM<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Due to a vegetable parasite. It affects the hair and the outer<br>
layer of skin and is highly contagious, being transmitted from one<br>
animal to another.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: The disease usually appears in the form of circular patches of<br>
the skin, which soon become denude of hair. Sometimes a white sticky<br>
discharge and the formation of scaly, brittle crusts on the patches<br>
appear, silvery gray in color. They are generally confined to the head<br>
and neck. It is a common disease among young cattle in the Winter and<br>
Spring. This disease is attended with more or less itching and is<br>
communicable to man.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Remove the scabs or crusts with soap and warm water. However,<br>
the surface of the body should be well dried after washing each time.<br>
Apply Tincture of Iodine with a camel-hair brush to the spots denuded of<br>
hair. It is quite necessary that the barn and rubbing posts be<br>
disinfected by spraying or washing them with a twenty-five per cent<br>
solution of Carbolic Acid.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
ROUND WORM<br>
<br>
CAUSE: An animal swallowing the eggs of the parasite in food or water<br>
which has been contaminated with the feces of infected cattle. There are<br>
two species, the large Roundworm measuring from five to fourteen inches<br>
in length, the other small Roundworm varying in size from one-quarter of<br>
an inch to two inches in length. Both the small and large Roundworms<br>
infest the intestines of cattle and calves. These worms, especially<br>
small Roundworms, irritate the mucous lining of the intestines, which<br>
may cause severe inflammation.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Anemia, appetite variable, diarrhoea, general weakness,<br>
dullness and excessive thirst; also a paleness of the visible membranes<br>
of the mouth, nose and eye. Worms frequently pass with the feces and can<br>
be readily seen by a close observer.<br>
<br>
PREVENTIVE TREATMENT: See prevention of Twisted Stomach Worm.<br>
<br>
MEDICAL TREATMENT: Withhold all food from eighteen to twenty-four hours.<br>
To calves, two to eight months old, give two teaspoonfuls of Turpentine<br>
in a pint of milk; to yearlings, give one tablespoonful. Place in<br>
gelatin capsule and give with capsule gun. To cattle one year old and<br>
over place one ounce in a gelatin capsule and give with capsule gun.<br>
This treatment is to be repeated twice during the intervals of ten days<br>
or two weeks, which insures the expulsion of the eggs of worms that<br>
escaped the first treatment. Also keep salt where cattle can lick it<br>
frequently.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
RUPTURE<br>
<br>
(Abdominal Hernia)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: This disease occasionally occurs in calves by receiving blows<br>
from the cow's horns on the right flank. After such an accident a<br>
swelling forms near the last ribs. This swelling may be either hot and<br>
painful or soft to the touch. It can be made to disappear by careful<br>
pressure when the sides of the rupture through which it has passed can<br>
be felt. On removing the pressure the rupture soon regains its swollen<br>
appearance. Similar conditions may also occur in aged cattle, usually<br>
due to injuries, such as being kicked by a horse, etc., or due to a<br>
weakness of the muscles that are ruptured sometimes during difficult<br>
birth.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Feed the animal on laxative food and feed sparingly on bulky<br>
food such as hay, straw and grass. Round the edges of a block of wood a<br>
little smaller, but the same shape as the rupture. After wrapping with<br>
cloth nicely, place it over the rupture, then place around the body.<br>
This permits the ruptured muscles to grow together, providing the animal<br>
is properly dieted as stated above.<br>
<br>
Sometimes a rupture of long standing or a newly produced rupture may be<br>
treated by injecting strong solutions of Common Salt around the torn<br>
edges of the muscles. This causes swelling and inflammation, which<br>
respectively forces the protruded intestines back and closes the<br>
opening. There is some danger attached to this method of treatment, and<br>
if attempted I would advise the services of a competent Veterinarian.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
SCUM OVER THE EYE<br>
<br>
CAUSE: See Inflammation of the Eye.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: The eye has a smoke-colored appearance.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Silver Nitrate, two grains, thoroughly dissolved in one ounce<br>
of Distilled Water, Apply with dropper two or three times a day. Feed<br>
the animal on food that is easily digested and confine the animal to a<br>
cool, clean, dark stall.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
SORE THROAT<br>
<br>
(Laryngitis and Pharyngitis)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Sudden cooling of the surface of the body, as when cattle are<br>
exposed to cold weather or cold rain or the inhaling of irritating<br>
gases.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: The muzzle is dry, temperature slightly elevated and saliva<br>
dribbles from the corners of the mouth. The animal either does not<br>
swallow, or swallows with great difficulty, and holds its head in a<br>
stiff, straight position, moving it as little as possible. The eyelids<br>
are half-closed and bloodshot, and the animal occasionally grinds the<br>
teeth. After masticating the food the animal drops it out of its mouth<br>
as if to avoid the pain of swallowing, and also evinces great pain when<br>
pressure is applied from the outside. In acute attacks of sore throat,<br>
the animal coughs with great difficulty and breathes very noisily. The<br>
nostrils are dilated and nose extended.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Place the animal in as comfortable a place as possible,<br>
permitting as much fresh air as possible, but avoiding drafts. Blanket<br>
the animal if the weather is chilly, also hand rub the legs and bandage<br>
with woolen cloths.<br>
<br>
Administer Chlorate of Potash, two ounces; Nitrate of Potash, two<br>
ounces; Tannic Acid, one-half ounce; Molasses, eight ounces. Mix well<br>
and place one tablespoonful on the tongue every three or four hours.<br>
Feed soft food, as wheat bran mashes and steamed rolled oats, or boiled<br>
vegetables. Give drinking water with the chill taken off.<br>
<br>
It is always necessary to apply liniments to the throat, and I would<br>
advise the application of Aqua Ammonia Fort., four ounces; Oil of<br>
Turpentine, four ounces, and Sweet Oil, four ounces. Apply and rub in<br>
well two or three times a day.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
STRINGY MILK<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Cows wading or standing in stagnant pools of water. Frequently<br>
stringy milk results from fungi entering the udder. This takes on an<br>
infectious form, and several cows may become affected at one time.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Although the milk appears perfectly normal when first milked,<br>
it becomes stringy after being let stand for a few hours. If a needle is<br>
inserted in the milk and slowly withdrawn, the milk will adhere to the<br>
point and have a stringy appearance. If the cow is examined carefully,<br>
the temperature will be found to be elevated a degree or two, the<br>
appetite poor and the nose dry.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Feed laxative food and see that they have fresh water to<br>
drink. Also, place two drams of Soda Bisulphite once or twice a day in<br>
gelatin capsule and give with capsule gun. Do not permit the cow to come<br>
in contact with stagnant pools of water that carry this infection.<br>
Perhaps the best plan is to fence out all such stagnant pools of water.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
SUPPRESSION OF MILK<br>
<br>
(Absence of Milk)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Unusually due to poor health, debility, emaciated, chronic<br>
diseases of the bag, or wasting of its glands from various diseases or<br>
impure food. Sometimes this condition is produced without any apparent<br>
cause.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Determine the cause, if possible, and remove it. Feed warm<br>
wheat bran mashes, steamed rolled oats or barley. Administer Pulv. Anise<br>
Seed, one-half ounce, two or three times a day. This has a very good<br>
effect in this particular condition. Also rub the bag and strip the<br>
teats often, and apply Oil of Lavender. The majority of cases respond to<br>
this treatment if not due to chronic disease of the bag.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
TAPEWORM<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Small portions of tapeworms, consisting of one or more segments,<br>
are occasionally seen in the droppings of infected cattle. The infection<br>
is undoubtedly taken in with the food or water, infection being spread<br>
by the eggs of the parasite, and being expelled with the feces of an<br>
infected animal. The eggs being swallowed by insects, worms or snails,<br>
which act as an intermediate host, and which when swallowed accidentally<br>
by cattle while grazing or drinking carry with them into the animal's<br>
stomach the infectious stage of the tapeworm. Aged cattle do not seem to<br>
suffer much from tapeworms, but in calves these parasites cause scours<br>
and rapid emaciation.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Emaciation, diarrhoea, loss of flesh, ravenous appetite,<br>
paleness of the mucous membranes of the mouth and eyes, and the segments<br>
of the tapeworms can occasionally be seen in the droppings.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Withhold all food from eighteen to twenty-four hours, and to<br>
calves from two to eight months old give two teaspoonfuls of gasoline in<br>
a pint of milk. To yearlings, place one tablespoonful in a gelatin<br>
capsule and give with capsule gun. To cattle one year and over, place<br>
one ounce in capsule and give with capsule gun. Repeat this treatment<br>
two or three times during intervals of a week or two.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
TEXAS FEVER<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Due to a micro organism (Piropalasna Bigenium) which imbeds<br>
itself in the red blood corpuscles. This disease is transmitted or<br>
scattered by means of a tick which drops from the affected animal. The<br>
disease has various names, according to the locality in which it<br>
appears. Among them are: Spanish Fever, Red Water, Black Water, Red<br>
Murrian, Australian Cattle Tick Fever, etc.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Loss of appetite. The animal ceases to ruminate, or does not<br>
chew the cud, and every sign of unthriftiness is displayed; a high<br>
temperature, and when the animal is standing the back is arched, but the<br>
animal, however, prefers to lie down most of the time and shows desire<br>
for solitude. The urine is very dark in color, hence the name "Red or<br>
Black Water." The disease is usually fatal, the animal dies within a few<br>
weeks.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: My advice is, when this disease once develops, or an animal<br>
shows any of the particular signs that I have mentioned, secure the<br>
services of a competent veterinarian, who will immunize by the use of<br>
serums, disinfectants, etc.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
TICKS<br>
<br>
Ticks are very difficult to kill, on account of their protected<br>
location, as ear ticks are not affected by dipping, and remedies strong<br>
enough for this purpose are liable to injure the animal, but these<br>
parasites may be expelled by pouring into the ear Carbolated Sweet or<br>
Cottonseed Oil with favorable results.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
TUBERCULOSIS<br>
<br>
CAUSE: The bacilli of Tuberculosis thrive in animals, especially those<br>
in a weakened condition, or when exposed to atmospheric changes,<br>
unwholesome food, dark and poorly ventilated stables. They gain entrance<br>
into the body through the lungs or the intestinal canal. They lodge in<br>
various portions of the lungs or intestines, and multiply very rapidly,<br>
causing irritations and formations, nodules, cysts or abscesses. They<br>
are the means of the bacillus entering the blood, which carries the<br>
infection to other parts of the body, as the spleen, liver, udder, womb,<br>
etc. Cows affected with generalized tuberculosis, that is to say, the<br>
infection is confined to not only a small portion of the lungs, but also<br>
to any of the above mentioned organs, etc., may give birth to a calf<br>
having general tuberculosis at birth, or shortly after, due to the cow's<br>
blood circulating through the body of the calf before birth.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: This disease may pass a casual observer unnoticed, although in<br>
some instances we notice a slight cough, unthriftiness, dullness. The<br>
coughing is best marked after taking a drink of water in the morning and<br>
then being exercised. Some animals keep up in good condition and look<br>
perfectly healthy while some get emaciated, have constipation, variable<br>
appetite, and sometimes growths or abscesses can be felt or seen in the<br>
udder or glands of the body and neck.<br>
<br>
However, cattle showing any weakness, or the above symptoms, should be<br>
tested for tuberculosis by a competent veterinarian who has had the<br>
privileges of a veterinary education and experience in the<br>
administration of tuberculin.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: It is not advisable to treat tuberculosis. Thus far, medicine<br>
has failed to relieve the affected animal, or kill the bacillus of<br>
tuberculosis in a living animal. The infected animals should be disposed<br>
of on account of tubercular cows giving birth to tubercular calves, the<br>
milk being unfit for human consumption, unless it is thoroughly<br>
pasteurized. Infected cattle should be separated from healthy ones, as<br>
the disease spreads very rapidly. Drinking and feeding troughs are a<br>
means of spreading the infection, therefore, suspected cases of<br>
tuberculosis should be tested and if the animals react, they should be<br>
slaughtered, and if the disease is localized, passed for human<br>
consumption. The meat of animals suspected of having tuberculosis, or<br>
reacting from tuberculin test, should be well cooked.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
TWISTED STOMACH WORM<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Cattle become affected with this worm by grazing in pastures in<br>
which infested cattle have grazed and scattered their droppings. The<br>
worms in the stomach produce a multitude of eggs of microscopic size,<br>
which pass out of the body with the feces. In warm weather, these eggs<br>
hatch in a few hours; if the temperature remains about freezing point,<br>
they soon die. The eggs are also destroyed, by dryness, but, on the<br>
other hand, moisture, if the weather is warm, favors their development.<br>
The twisted worm measures one-half inch to one and one-half inches in<br>
length.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: General weakness, loss of flesh, anemia, dullness, capricious<br>
appetite, excessive thirst, paleness of the skin and mucous membranes of<br>
the mouth and eyes, and dropsical swelling, especially that of the lower<br>
jaw. Diarrhoea always accompanies this condition and if the feces is<br>
carefully examined the small worms may be seen wriggling about like<br>
little snakes, or when an animal dies; and the fourth stomach is opened,<br>
these worms can be seen in large quantities.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Preventive measures are important, as damp, marshy soil<br>
favors the development of the embryos. High sloping ground is preferable<br>
for pasture. If low ground is used it should be properly drained;<br>
burning over the pasture will destroy most of the young worms on the<br>
grass and on the ground. Cattle should be supplied with water from<br>
flowing streams or wells and not stagnant ponds.<br>
<br>
MEDICAL TREATMENT: Withhold all food for twenty-four hours; then<br>
administer Oil of Turpentine, placing it in an ounce capsule and give<br>
with capsule gun. Follow in six hours with a physic consisting of Aloin,<br>
two drams; ginger, two drams. Place in capsule and give with capsule<br>
gun. When this worm develops in calves, give as follows: One dram of<br>
Turpentine to a calf three months old, four drams to a calf six months<br>
old, six drams to a yearling. To cattle two years and over, give<br>
equivalent dose, or an ounce. The physic should be reduced in the same<br>
proportions as that of Turpentine.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
VERMINOUS BRONCHITIS<br>
<br>
(Lung Worms)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Due to worm or parasite called Strongylus Micrurus, a small<br>
thread-like worm two to four inches in length, found in the bronchial<br>
tubes, a portion of the lungs. The life history of this parasite is not<br>
known, but infection is apparently derived through the medium of<br>
pastures where infested cattle have grazed. Young cattle are more<br>
seriously affected than old animals, especially common in low marshy<br>
pastures.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: This form of bronchitis usually affects the entire herd; the<br>
animals become poor, unthrifty, hacking, coughing, especially at night,<br>
and sometimes animals actually cough up worms.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Various treatments have been recommended for Verminous<br>
Bronchitis, or Lung Worm, as injecting Turpentine into the windpipe or<br>
fumigating animals by placing them in a closed shed or barn and burning<br>
sulphur, compelling the affected animals to inhale the fumes. This<br>
treatment perhaps is the safest and the most effective. A person should<br>
remain in the enclosed shed and when the fumes become so strong that<br>
there is danger of suffocation, open the doors and windows. This<br>
treatment should be repeated every week until coughing ceases.<br>

<br>
WARBLES OR GRUBS<br>
<br>
CAUSE: By the heel-fly or warble-fly. They deposit their eggs on the<br>
legs of cattle during the fall. The animal, licking the parts, takes the<br>
eggs into its mouth. These eggs gradually migrate into the gullet, where<br>
they hatch and burrow through the tissues, and in the early spring will<br>
be found in the region of the back in the form of small lumps under the<br>
skin.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Warbles are frequently seen under the skin in the region of<br>
the back and over the loins, and are very tender to the touch. When they<br>
are fully developed they work their way through the skin, which usually<br>
occurs in the early part of the summer. Examine your cattle in the<br>
winter and spring for the presence of grubs. They can be easily found by<br>
running the hand over the loins, by abrupt swellings or bunches on the<br>
skin. Pressure on the swellings will perhaps cause the grubs to pop out.<br>
<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Remove the grubs by making a small incision with a clean,<br>
sharp knife in the center of the swelling. Then press them out and into<br>
each cavity from which the grub has been extracted, or squeezed out,<br>
should be injected a five per cent solution of Carbolized Sweet Oil to<br>
prevent any further development of flies or grubs. Cattle sprayed with<br>
fly repellants during the spring and summer are very seldom bothered<br>
with warbles or grubs. However, this is not practical in range cattle;<br>
dipping instead should be resorted to, and it is surprising what results<br>
will be derived from fly repellants in a year or two. They will<br>
practically exterminate the pest, and consequently the cattle are<br>
thrifty and look much better.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
WARTS<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Warts may appear on various parts of the body, and are due to an<br>
abnormal growth of cells growing upon the outer surface of healthy skin,<br>
or they may grow upon skin that is deprived of the proper blood supply.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: If the wart is located where there is hair surrounding it,<br>
cut away the hair, then wash the wart and surrounding parts with a five<br>
per cent solution of Carbolic Acid and clip the wart off with a sharp<br>
pair of scissors or knife. After the wart is removed, cauterize the cut<br>
surface with a hot iron. Caustic Potash or Silver Nitrate should be<br>
applied two or three times at the intervals of two or three days to<br>
insure the entire extermination of the wart. This same treatment applies<br>
to all classes of warts located in various places.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
WHITES<br>
<br>
(Leucorrhea)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Continual chronic inflammation of the womb, or due to irritations<br>
from a retained afterbirth. Injuries or wounds inflicted by hands or<br>
instruments in difficult calving, diseases of the ovaries, etc.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: A glarish, white discharge from the womb. When cow is lying<br>
down it flows more abundantly, soiling the tail, etc. The general health<br>
may not be much affected at first, but if the discharge continues and is<br>
putrid, the health fails, the milk shrinks, and there is a great loss of<br>
flesh. In some cases heat is more frequent or intense than natural, but<br>
the animal rarely conceives when served, and if she does, is likely to<br>
abort.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Feed nitrogenous food. Wash the womb out with a solution<br>
consisting of five grains of Permanganate of Potash to one quart of<br>
water. This should be repeated once or twice a day. If the animal is<br>
constipated, give two drams of Aloin, three drams of Ginger. Place in<br>
gelatin capsule and give with capsule gun. Also place Potassium Iodide<br>
one dram, Hyposulphite of Soda one ounce in the drinking water two or<br>
three times a day. This not only diminishes the discharge, but has a<br>
good effect on the blood, particularly where there is more or less<br>
decomposition of the flesh.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
WOLF IN THE TAIL<br>
<br>
This condition is imaginary, although the muscles of the tail relax or<br>
soften, especially those of its extremity, due to ill health;<br>
consequently the condition of the cow should be treated, and not the<br>
tail.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Remove the cause. Perhaps the animal has indigestion, or a<br>
cold, etc. Determine the malady by careful examination and treat the<br>
disease under its special heading.<br>
<br>
It has been a custom among the so-called cow doctors to split the tail<br>
with a sharp knife, then fill the wound with salt and pepper and bandage<br>
with a cloth. This is a fallacy, and should not be tolerated.<br>

<br>
HOG REGULATOR AND TONIC<br>
<br>
Nux Vomica, one pound; Hardwood Charcoal, two pounds; Sulphur, two<br>
pounds; Common Salt, three pounds; Sulphide of Antimony, one and<br>
one-half pounds; Glauber Salts, two pounds; Bicarbonate of Soda, four<br>
pounds; Hyposulphite of Soda, four pounds; Nitrate of Potash, one pound;<br>
Quassia, one-half pound; Gentian Root, one pound; Iron Sulphate, one<br>
pound; pulverize and mix well.<br>
<br>
To everyone hundred pounds of hog weight, give one tablespoonful in feed<br>
or swill once or twice daily. For hogs weighing two hundred pounds, the<br>
dose would be two tablespoonfuls; for a hog weighing fifty pounds,<br>
one-half tablespoonful.<br>
<br>
Hogs, like other animals, require tonics, bowel regulators and worm<br>
expellers. For these purposes, I have prescribed under a number of the<br>
diseases of hogs, which I cover in this chapter, the above general tonic<br>
and regulator which I have used in my personal practice with marked<br>
success, especially serving the purpose of aiding hogs in their<br>
convalescence from debilitating diseases and in their recovery from a<br>
general run-down condition.<br>
<br>
Aside from its general tonic and regulative effect, this prescription<br>
contains nerve tonics, intestinal antiseptics, laxatives, worm<br>
expellers, and aids digestion, etc.<br>
<br>
If regularly given to hogs, and sanitary conditions are maintained, this<br>
tonic and regulator will largely fortify them against contagious<br>
diseases.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
ABORTION<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Sows may abort at any state of pregnancy by slipping, falling,<br>
receiving kicks, or by being caught while crawling through or under<br>
fences. Sows may also abort when allowed to crawl into quarters where<br>
there are other hogs. Contagious diseases, such as Cholera and<br>
Pleuropneumonia also produce abortion. There is also a contagious form<br>
of abortion in sows, but this is very uncommon, as the disease spreads<br>
very slowly.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: There is no warning given, as a rule; the sows expel their<br>
pigs before any signs of abortion are noticed.<br>
<br>
In other cases the sows refuse to eat, become uneasy, shivering and<br>
trembling of the muscles, and straining or labor pains are noticed. As a<br>
rule, when a sow aborts, she will not prepare a bed, as she would<br>
normally.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Preventive is the only safe and sure treatment, although when<br>
the first sign of abortion appears, and there are no signs of the<br>
membranes coming away, remove the sow to quiet, warm, clean quarters by<br>
herself, and if straining, give one dram of Chloral-Hydrate in her<br>
drinking water every two or three hours.<br>
<br>
When a sow aborts, burn the pigs and afterbirth, and disinfect the pens<br>
with a Coal Tar disinfectant. Keep this up for several days, and do not<br>
breed until all discharges from the vagina have ceased flowing.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
ADMINISTRATION OF MEDICINE TO HOGS<br>
<br>
To administer medicine to hogs may seem easy, but, nevertheless, it is a<br>
difficult task. Never lay a hog on his back to drench him, as in so<br>
doing there is great danger of strangling. The proper method is to stand<br>
or set him on end, holding him up by the ears, and by the use of a<br>
bottle with a piece of hose drawn over its neck, give the medicine very<br>
slowly, so as not to allow a large quantity to accumulate in the mouth<br>
or throat at one time. There is always danger of some of the liquid<br>
escaping into the lungs and causing the hog to strangle, and thus it may<br>
produce pneumonia. However, this is the best method of giving hogs<br>
medicine by force.<br>
<br>
Hogs will generally take medicine in their feed or drinking water,<br>
unless they are very sick, or the medicine is extremely disagreeable to<br>
the taste.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
BAG INFLAMMATION<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Injuries, obstructed teats, accumulation of milk in the sow's bag<br>
after the loss of part of or all of her litter. Difficult birth, slight<br>
wounds in the bag permit invasion of germs, which is frequently the<br>
common cause of bag inflammation.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Heat, pain and swelling in one or more teats. The general body<br>
temperature is elevated one or two degrees above normal. The sow perhaps<br>
refuses her feed, although she will drink water in large quantities.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Feed soft, sloppy food and vegetables. Give Epsom Salts, two<br>
to four ounces, in milk or feed. It is also well to milk the sow by<br>
hand, relieving her of the milk three or four times a day. This is very<br>
necessary. Camphorated Oil is very soothing, and I would recommend its<br>
use freely only over affected teats.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
BLACK TOOTH<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Black Tooth, so called in swine, is principally due to injuries<br>
to the teeth received by chewing hard matter, such as bone, etc., which<br>
causes them to decay.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Toothache. Toothache in swine is similar to that exhibited by<br>
man, in showing loss of appetite, salivation, or slobbering, hanging the<br>
head mostly to the side which is affected, loss of fear of man, and<br>
offensive breath. If the hogs are fed on strongly acid food for any<br>
length of time, their teeth may become dark colored. As the teeth are<br>
not materially injured; so long as decayed tooth substance cannot be<br>
noticed, and while the appetite and chewing facilities of the hog do not<br>
appear to be diminished, no interference will be necessary.<br>
<br>
It is customary with some people to examine the teeth of hogs, and if<br>
one tooth is found darker colored than the others, it is supposed to be<br>
the cause of the hog not doing well, if he is in a poor condition, and<br>
the tooth is hammered off flush with the jaw, leaving the broken roots,<br>
lacerated gums and nerves to increase the hog's suffering. If the hog<br>
recovers, it is often concluded that this was a case of Black Tooth.<br>
<br>
My advice is, if you are determined to have the tooth out, extract it<br>
properly. Do not break it off. When your hogs are not thriving, give<br>
them the regulator and tonic prescribed on the first page of this<br>
chapter.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
BLOOD POISONING<br>
<br>
(Pyemia Septicemia)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Due to the toxic substance produced by germs that invade wounds,<br>
bruises, abscesses, or womb following farrowing, if lacerated.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: The seat of injury becomes swollen, pus may adhere to the<br>
hair, temperature elevated, appetite poor, hog moves about very slowly,<br>
becomes separated from the rest of the drove, lies around in some cool,<br>
quiet place, eventually becomes very weak and poor and dies, if good<br>
attention is not given.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Separate from the other hogs and remove to a clean,<br>
comfortable place and wash the seat of injury with some good<br>
disinfectant, as a five per cent Carbolic Acid solution. In case of<br>
abscess, open it low so as to assure good drainage. Keep clean, cool<br>
water before your hogs at all times. Give mashes made from wheat bran<br>
and hot water, or any good, substantial food that is easily digested<br>
containing regulator and tonic prescribed on the first page of this<br>
chapter.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
BRONCHITIS<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Lung worms, poorly ventilated sleeping quarters, sleeping in<br>
straw stacks, in manure heaps, overheated, filthy pens, where the<br>
animals inhale irritating gases given off the bodies of other hogs, and<br>
from filth. Smoke and dust are very common producers of bronchitis.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Breathing fast, appetite poor, slight rise in temperature and<br>
coughing. The hog is dull and stupid, refuses food, but drinks water<br>
frequently.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Preventive; avoid the above named causes, but when hogs<br>
become affected, move them to clean, well ventilated quarters, avoiding<br>
dust and gases, disinfect bedding and floors with some good<br>
disinfectant, as Crude Carbolic Acid, sprayed. Also give large doses of<br>
the hog regulator and tonic, as prescribed on the first page of this<br>
chapter. Feed vegetables, or any easily digested food, and hot wheat<br>
bran mashes.<br>
<br>
In case the disease is due to lung worms, confine the animals in a<br>
closed shed and permit them to inhale the steam from Turpentine and<br>
water for a few minutes, by placing water and Turpentine in a tin<br>
receptacle holding about two gallons, and inserting heated bricks or<br>
stones into the solution.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CASTRATION<br>
<br>
This is generally understood by every stockraiser, yet there are some<br>
points many do not know. For instance, you should use in this operation<br>
an antiseptic solution, as Carbolic Acid or Bichloride of Mercury. Wash<br>
thoroughly with antiseptic yours hands and knife, also the seat of<br>
operation and make your incision as low as possible to permit the pus to<br>
drain out nicely. If this is not practiced, the pus will become absorbed<br>
into the blood, producing blood poison, which may produce death, or at<br>
the best will cause the hog to become stunted, whereas, if the operation<br>
is performed properly, the hog will thrive, regardless of the shock from<br>
the operation. I may add that it is much better to castrate pigs or hogs<br>
when their stomach and intestines are empty, and it is always good<br>
practice to feed laxative and easily digested foods sparingly after this<br>
operation.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHOKING<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Vegetables, such as potatoes, etc., roots, as carrots, turnips<br>
and sometimes pieces of bone or glass, lodge in the gullet. Paralysis of<br>
the muscular fibres of the gullet is a very common cause of choking in<br>
swine.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: The hog is unable to swallow, producing frothing at the mouth<br>
and, if the obstruction cannot be dislodged, death occurs in a very<br>
short time. Sometimes the obstruction in the gullet may be felt from the<br>
outside with the hand.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: The administration of small doses of Raw Linseed or Olive<br>
Oil, or Lard, will assist in dislodging the obstruction. Also careful<br>
manipulation of the gullet from the outside with the hand assists in<br>
either forcing it into the stomach or bringing it out through hog's<br>
mouth. If vomiting can be produced, it will dislodge the obstruction. If<br>
immediate results are not obtained from the above treatments, I would<br>
recommend butchering the hog for meat immediately.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
COLD IN THE HEAD<br>
<br>
(Nasal Catarrh)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Exposure to cold; a very common condition in cold, wet weather<br>
when hogs are allowed to sleep in manure heaps, straw stacks, or pile up<br>
together, when they become overheated and later chill. Nasal Catarrh may<br>
also be due to inhaling dust or irritating gases.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: The animal is stupid and feverish, coughing and sneezing<br>
frequently; appetite is poor, eyes watery and inflamed; a discharge of<br>
mucus from the nose will terminate in yellow pus and the nose, if<br>
examined, is found to be inflamed and ulcerated.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: The best and safest treatment is to provide clean sleeping<br>
quarters, avoid overcrowding in dusty, dirty sheds, especially during<br>
cold weather. Pigs affected with cold in the head should be fed on<br>
laxative food, such as boiled carrots, potatoes, apples, hot wheat bran<br>
mashes and steamed rolled oats.<br>
<br>
MEDICAL TREATMENT: Confine the affected hogs to a shed, close windows<br>
and doors and any large cracks; then compel them to inhale steam from<br>
the following mixture: Turpentine, eight ounces; Pine Tar, one pint;<br>
Water, two gallons. Place in tin receptacle in center of shed and heat<br>
the above solution by adding hot bricks or stones to the mixture<br>
occasionally. Compel the hogs to inhale this steam for at least thirty<br>
minutes twice a day. Give Chlorate of Potash in twenty grain doses three<br>
times a day in feed or drinking water. This treatment is very successful<br>
if the inflammation has not extended to the lungs.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
DIARRHOEA IN YOUNG PIGS<br>
<br>
(Scours)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Decomposed foods, slops, etc., fed to the mothers, causing them<br>
to give toxic milk. Poorly ventilated, filthy, cold and damp pens,<br>
insufficient exercise, lack of sunlight, raising pigs by hand or with<br>
other sow.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Frequent movement of the bowels, the passage being of a<br>
grayish-white color and the odor very disagreeable. At this stage of<br>
the disease, reliable remedies must be given or the pig will die very<br>
soon.<br>
<br>
The discharge from the bowels becomes very thin, the tail and legs<br>
become soiled, loss of appetite, the pigs become weak and dull, hair<br>
rough and it is difficult for them to move about. In very young pigs,<br>
treatment is of little value.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: As Scours in pigs is a disease frequently caused by faulty<br>
food and insanitary surroundings, a preventive treatment is of great<br>
importance, and much better results are thus obtained than by the use of<br>
medical agents. Medical treatment consists in first cleaning away the<br>
irritant present in the bowels. For this purpose give one to two<br>
tablespoonfuls of Castor Oil. At the time of farrowing all sows should<br>
receive a light diet and be kept in clean, dry quarters. The pigs should<br>
be allowed pure air, sunshine and exercise. If the sow appears hot and<br>
feverish, give one to three ounces of Castor Oil in milk or swill. Avoid<br>
feeding decomposed, moldy food, or sour milk. To check the diarrhoea in<br>
pigs, use the following after the irritant is removed or cleaned out as<br>
above stated: Zinc Sulphocarbolates, thirty grains; Protan, two ounces;<br>
Pulv. Gentian Root, two ounces. Make into sixty capsules or powders and<br>
give one, three or four times a day. The sow should receive a dose about<br>
eight times the size of that of the pigs.<br>

<br>
<br>
HOG CHOLERA<br>
<br>
CAUSE: By the Bacillus Sius; contaminated food, stagnant water, filth,<br>
etc., all have a tendency to aid its progress. I have seen farms,<br>
although located in sections where Cholera was prevalent, not in the<br>
least troubled with the malady, perhaps due to careful feeding of clean<br>
foods, care in watering, cleanliness about the pens and sheds and<br>
disinfecting occasionally, but no doubt a better explanation is that<br>
those hogs received tonics, containing worm expellers, at least four<br>
times a year. Many a case of supposed Hog Cholera is due to worms<br>
irritating and producing inflammation of the intestines, followed by<br>
diarrhoea. A person not familiar with the disease calls this "hog<br>
cholera." In other cases, hogs which are fed swills from restaurants,<br>
hotels, etc., containing soap, washing powders, small particles of<br>
glass, etc., will die with symptoms leading a person to think they had<br>
Hog Cholera, but if a thorough investigation is made the true cause of<br>
death can easily be discovered.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: In true Hog Cholera, the temperature will be elevated two to<br>
four degrees above normal. There will be a loss of appetite, vomiting,<br>
diarrhoea, although there may be constipation when the hog is first<br>
affected. The hog wanders off by itself to some cool, quiet place and<br>
lies down. When it walks it will stagger and show great stiffness in its<br>
hind parts, due to soreness of the intestines. The hair will have a<br>
roughened appearance, the back arched, the eyes inflamed and discharging<br>
pus, red blotches will show themselves back of the ears, inside the legs<br>
and on the abdomen. At this stage the diarrhoea is watery, dark and<br>
tinged with blood, and very offensive in odor, breath is very fast and<br>
labored. The hog grows very weak and dies.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Prevention must always be borne in mind. Do not feed filthy<br>
food. Always feed good, wholesome food, and give clean water to drink.<br>
Watch the condition of hog's bowels and regulate them by feeding. Burn<br>
manure and bedding and disinfect carefully. Do not permit your hogs to<br>
drink out of running streams of water, especially if Hog Cholera is in<br>
your neighborhood. When buying hogs, it is well to keep them off by<br>
themselves for two or three weeks, as they may be diseased. Do not<br>
permit neighbors, their stock or dogs on your premises when Hog Cholera<br>
is raging, as the infection of Hog Cholera can be spread very rapidly by<br>
matter from the affected hogs adhering to the shoes of man, to the feet<br>
of stock and dogs, etc.<br>
<br>
I am positive that if this method were properly practiced by all hog<br>
raisers and feeders, Hog Cholera would be a very rare disease.<br>
<br>
SERUM TREATMENT: This is successful in some cases, and in others<br>
unsuccessful. The latter perhaps is due to poor serums, or the disease<br>
being so far advanced in its progress that the hogs are beyond recovery.<br>
Serum treatment is very expensive and, as it requires a strictly septic<br>
operation of injecting the serum, the average hog raiser or grower is<br>
not qualified to administer the treatment properly. An additional and<br>
necessary expense is the services of a Veterinary Surgeon. Therefore, I<br>
strongly urge adoption of preventive measures as stated. Use some good<br>
disinfectant, such as Crude Carbolic Acid, which destroys the Bacillus<br>
of Hog Cholera. Also administer hog regulator and tonic as prescribed on<br>
first page of this chapter. This will expel worms, tone the system,<br>
regulate the bowels and fortify your hogs against Hog Cholera.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
INDIGESTION<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Worms are perhaps one of the most common causes. Unwholesome,<br>
irritating food or swill containing soap or washing powder have a<br>
tendency to derange the process of digestion.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Abdominal pain, vomiting, back arched, breathing rapid and<br>
temperature elevated from two to three degrees. There may be diarrhoea<br>
or the animal may be constipated. Vomiting, as a rule, relieves acute<br>
attacks by expelling the irritant from the bowels. When it takes a<br>
chronic form, the hogs become stunted.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Endeavor to find out the cause and remove it. If constipated,<br>
give Calomel, fifteen to twenty grains, or, if diarrhoea appears, give<br>
hog regulator and tonic as prescribed on first page of this chapter.<br>
Feed with hot wheat bran mashes. This will expel all worms and aid<br>
digestion.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
JAUNDICE<br>
<br>
(Yellows)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Liver flukes, intestinal worms, gall stones, lack of exercise,<br>
overfeeding, or a stoppage of the bile duct.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: The white portions of the eyes take on a yellow color, as do<br>
the membranes of the mouth, back arched, hair looks rough, vomiting,<br>
temperature elevated, constipation, although diarrhoea is sometimes<br>
noticed. The urine is passed frequently, and is of a dark amber color.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: This disease requires careful feeding and plenty of exercise.<br>
Give Calomel, ten to twenty grains, then follow with large doses of<br>
regulator and tonic as prescribed on first page of this chapter. It is<br>
important in this disease, especially if due to worms. Feed clean swill<br>
and vegetables. Give hogs all the pure water they will drink.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
KIDNEY CONGESTION<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Hogs are subject to various injuries about the kidneys, due to a<br>
large number of hogs piling up, exposure to cold, wet rains, etc.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Small quantities of dark colored urine are passed frequently,<br>
appetite poor, no energy to move about. Hogs lie around a great deal; at<br>
times they may be paralyzed and drag their hind quarters.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Apply cloths or blankets wrung out of hot water over the<br>
loin; also give Potassium Acetate in twenty grain doses four or five<br>
times a day in drinking water. Feed soft, sloppy food, containing<br>
regulator and tonic as prescribed on the first page of this chapter. It<br>
contains nerve stimulants, just what is required in paralysis.<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
KIDNEY WORM<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Damp, filthy surroundings seem to favor the growth of embryos of<br>
this worm. They are taken into the digestive canal with the food and<br>
eventually pass to the region of the kidneys, where they find conditions<br>
favorable in which to multiply.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: May produce paralysis of the hind quarters, in which case the<br>
animal would not exhibit such marked tenderness on being pressed over<br>
the loins with the fingers as it would if the weakness of the hind<br>
quarters was due to a sprain or to rheumatism of the loins. Occasionally<br>
hogs may suffer from the presence of one or more worms in the kidneys;<br>
but the ailment is rarely fatal, becoming so only after a long time of<br>
suffering resulting in a degeneration of one or both kidneys. It is<br>
almost impossible to diagnose the presence of worms in the kidneys of<br>
hogs, except by chance through a microscopic examination of the urine.<br>
If worms are found in the kidneys of a hog that has died or been<br>
slaughtered for food it may then be reasonably supposed that other hogs<br>
of the same herd not acting normal are infected with worms of the same<br>
species.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Teaspoonful doses of Turpentine in milk three times a week is<br>
the only treatment I could recommend. Preventive measures is the only<br>
practical method of treating a disease of this nature. Give your hogs<br>
pure water and food. Disinfect pens occasionally and keep them clean.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
LICE ON HOGS<br>
<br>
Dip, spray or scrub your hogs with some good Coal Tar disinfectant, but<br>
whatever remedy is used it should be applied more than once which, of<br>
course, causes considerable work where there is a large number of hogs<br>
infested, unless dipped, which is more quickly done. The reason for<br>
repeated applications being necessary is that although the lice which<br>
hogs pick up from the ground, bedding and rubbing places, may be killed<br>
by first application, it often does not affect the nits, which remain<br>
intact and hatch within a week or ten days. A new crop of Lice appears<br>
on the hog from this source. Remove all manure and bedding from pens and<br>
sheds and burn it. Disinfect floors and spray sides of shed, pens and<br>
rubbing places with disinfectants, one part to seventy-two parts of<br>
water, once a month and you will be handsomely repaid for your labor.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
LUNG FEVER<br>
<br>
(Inflammation of the Lungs)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Sudden changes, exposure to storms, piling up of hogs during cold<br>
nights, or sleeping in manure heaps, old straw stacks, etc.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Pig or hog is taken with shivering spells, is stupid, his back<br>
is arched, loss of appetite, temperature elevated two to four degrees<br>
above normal, short hurried breathing, generally accompanied with cough,<br>
which is deep and hoarse. As a rule the hog is constipated.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Place in good, clean, warm, well ventilated quarters, free<br>
from drafts. Keep water before them at all times, adding Saltpeter, one<br>
teaspoonful to every gallon of water. If constipated, do not give<br>
physics; give injections of soap and warm water; also administer about<br>
one-half teaspoonful of Pine Tar on the tongue with a wooden paddle.<br>
This adheres to the tongue and gradually dissolves and gives excellent<br>
results, as it is very soothing to the organs of breathing. During the<br>
convalescent stage, give hog regulator and tonic as prescribed on first<br>
page of this chapter.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
LUNG WORMS<br>
<br>
CAUSE: By threadlike worms varying in length from one-half to one and<br>
one-half inches and of a brownish-white color. They are found in the<br>
windpipe and tubes leading into the lungs. The adult worms in the lungs<br>
produce large quantities of eggs, which are coughed up with mucus and<br>
become scattered over premises where other hogs are permitted to walk.<br>
The hogs inhale the dust containing the eggs into their lungs, where the<br>
eggs find moisture sufficient for their development.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Severe coughing spells. Large quantities of mucus will escape<br>
from the nose and mouth. The hog becomes stunted, although he may eat<br>
fairly well, but if not relieved, the worms collect in the Bronchi and<br>
produce sudden death due to suffocation. The worms may set up an<br>
inflammation of the lining membranes of the lungs, which is sometimes<br>
taken for Swine Plague, or Cholera. This disease is not uncommon,<br>
especially in old, filthy, poorly drained hog houses and pastures.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Confine the affected hogs to a shed; close the windows and<br>
doors and any large cracks, then compel the hogs to inhale steam from<br>
the following mixture: Turpentine, eight ounces; Pine Tar, one pint;<br>
Water, two gallons. Place in tin receptacle in center of the shed and<br>
heat the above solution by adding hot bricks or stones to the mixture<br>
occasionally. Compel them to inhale this steam for at least thirty<br>
minutes twice a day. Feed wholesome food to which add hog tonic as<br>
prescribed on first page of this chapter. A strong, vigorous hog may<br>
have worms, but it retains its vitality so long as it is well fed.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
MANGE<br>
<br>
CAUSE: By the Sarcoptes Scabei. This parasite burrows under the outer<br>
surface of the skin.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: The parasite usually manifests itself on the skin under the<br>
armpits, thighs and inside of the fore legs. At first small red blotches<br>
or pimples appear, and these gradually spread as the parasites multiply<br>
and burrow under the skin.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: There is no other way of curing this disease, or of<br>
preventing it, than by killing the parasites and their eggs; not only on<br>
the pigs themselves, but also on the sides of the pens, sheds,<br>
rubbing-posts, or anything that an affected hog rubs against.<br>
<br>
When treating this disease, the real aim must be to kill the parasite by<br>
the prompt and continuous use of external remedies, such as washing or<br>
dipping, which is better done with some good disinfectant, one part to<br>
seventy parts water. Repeat this every ten days until cured. Two<br>
dippings are generally sufficient. It is well to feed cooling foods,<br>
such as clean slops and vegetables, containing regulator and tonic as<br>
prescribed on first page of this chapter.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
NAVEL RUPTURE<br>
<br>
(Navel or Umbilical)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Injuries. Pigs crowding through narrow doorways or openings in<br>
fences, small pigs sleeping with large pigs, and allowed to pile up, or<br>
being thrown about feed troughs when feeding. Weakness and constipation<br>
also predisposes them to Navel or Umbilical Rupture.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: A soft, puffy swelling about the navel or umbilicus, varying<br>
in size from a hazelnut to that of an ostrich egg. When a pig is placed<br>
on its back the intestines will gravitate into the abdominal cavity,<br>
providing the intestines have not adhered to the walls of the rupture.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: This is more difficult than the Scrotal or Inguinal Rupture<br>
operation, as often times the intestines will adhere to the inner<br>
surface of the rupture and, unless the operation is carefully performed,<br>
there is great danger. Great care must be exercised in preparing the pig<br>
by fasting it for twenty-four hours. After this is accomplished, prepare<br>
an antiseptic solution, Carbolic Acid, five per cent, or Bichloride of<br>
Mercury, one in one-thousandths; also have a needle and absorbent silk<br>
or cat-gut ready. Place the pig on its back, with its head downward.<br>
Now, wash the seat of operation with either antiseptic solution. Then<br>
make an incision through the skin carefully; as stated before,<br>
intestines sometimes adhere to the inner surface of the rupture. If such<br>
is the case, wash the hands in the antiseptic solution and with the<br>
fingers carefully break the adhesions or separate the intestines from<br>
their adhesions. After this is accomplished, sew the inner lining of the<br>
abdominal cavity with absorbent silk or cat-gut. Then sew the outer skin<br>
with cotton or linen cord and your operation is complete. Feed the hog<br>
sparingly for a few days following the operation on easily digested,<br>
laxative foods.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
NETTLE RASH<br>
<br>
(Urticaria)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Irritations of the skin produced by sprinkling hogs with<br>
irritating solutions and powders, or from irritating dips when treating<br>
for lice, etc. Feeding highly nitrogenous food predisposes hogs to this<br>
disease; also filth, poorly drained sheds and pens; is especially common<br>
in young pigs. Nettle Rash is not contagious, but what produces it in<br>
one hog may produce it in several at the same time.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Red, swollen blotches appear on the skin very suddenly,<br>
especially about the ears and the inside of the thighs, perhaps due to<br>
the skin being thin and deprived of hair. The hog rubs it on account of<br>
the intense itching, and he will not thrive when in this condition. In<br>
most cases there is a fluid oozing from the blotches, causing dirt and<br>
filth to adhere to the hair. However, if the disease is properly<br>
treated, a recovery is sure to follow in about two weeks.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Prevention against this disease is most important, and it<br>
consists in keeping shoats and pigs in clean, well ventilated sheds and<br>
pens. Do not sprinkle them with irritating solutions or powders, or<br>
irritating dips, but when the disease once shows itself give each pig or<br>
hog affected a dose of Epsom Salts, one ounce to every twenty-five<br>
pounds of hog weight, in feed, swill or drinking water. If the weather<br>
is hot, keep them in a clean, cool place, also purify their blood by<br>
feeding regulator and tonic as prescribed on first page of this chapter.<br>
<br>
Apply some good Coal Tar disinfectant, one part to one hundred parts of<br>
water. This is non-irritating, and will destroy hog lice, and will heal<br>
the pustules of nettle rash. Apply twice ten days apart. It also must be<br>
borne in mind that pens and sleeping quarters must be disinfected; the<br>
old bedding and manure burned and replaced with good, clean straw or<br>
hay. Feed easily digested food, slops, etc.<br>

<br>
PARALYSIS OF THE HIND QUARTERS<br>
<br>
CAUSE: There are a great many things that may produce paralysis of the<br>
hind quarters. For instance, shipping hogs in crates; fractions of thigh<br>
bones; Rickets, due to feeding food that is deficient in mineral matter;<br>
hogs piling up; kicks or injuries to the back; frequently seen in sows<br>
nursing a litter of pigs and in a run-down condition. Constipation and<br>
indigestion also produce paralysis of the hind quarters. Some think it<br>
is caused by worms in the kidneys; this is not always the case. It is<br>
true that the presence of a parasite around the kidneys may cause<br>
irritation of the nerves of the spinal column and result in paralysis.<br>
Yet, it is more often the result of weakness and loss of nervous power<br>
of the hind parts.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Regardless of the cause, the symptoms in either case, for they<br>
cannot be distinguished, are weakness of the back, wriggling of the hind<br>
parts, and finally the hogs sit down on their haunches. After some<br>
effort, they get up and run in a straight line quite fast, but swing to<br>
one side for a while and then go over to the other side, and finally get<br>
down so that they cannot rise, but drag themselves about. The appetite<br>
is good until a day or two before they die.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Place the hog in clean, comfortable quarters, with plenty of<br>
fresh water to drink. Give sour milk, fruit or vegetables, containing<br>
regulator and tonic as prescribed on first page of this chapter. It<br>
contains nerve stimulants and blood purifiers. If the hog is<br>
constipated, add two to four ounces of Epsom Salts to its feed.<br>
Treatment of all such cases requires perseverance, recovery being slow<br>
and not always certain.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
PILES<br>
<br>
(Prolapse of the Anus)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Although the pig may look well, he has a weakness of the circular<br>
fibres of the intestines, due to irritating foods that either constipate<br>
or produce diarrhoea.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Very plain. A protrusion of the rectum all the way from two to<br>
four inches. The pig irritates the protrusion by rubbing it against the<br>
sides of pens, etc.; it cracks, bleeds and in warm weather will become<br>
fly-blown and maggots accumulate in large quantities.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: In the first stages of this disease, wash the protruded parts<br>
with an antiseptic solution of Carbolic Acid, one teaspoonful to a pint<br>
of water. Give rectal injections of Soap and Warm Water or Sweet Oil,<br>
give about two ounces of Castor Oil internally and feed soft, sloppy<br>
food. In chronic cases of long standing, remove the exposed portion of<br>
the intestine after washing nicely with the antiseptic solution. Remove<br>
the protrusion with a sharp knife and stitch the cut end of intestine<br>
edges to the anus. Feed easily digested food, such as wheat bran, mixed<br>
with flaxseed meal on which boiling hot water has been poured, cooling<br>
before feeding. Also give regulator and tonic as prescribed on first<br>
page of this chapter.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
PIN WORMS<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Hogs consume the eggs that encapsule well matured embryonic worms<br>
with their food or drinking water. These worms multiply very rapidly in<br>
the small intestines and are from one-half to one inch in length.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: No signs are noticed unless the worms are very abundant, as<br>
they are small and difficult to see with the naked eye. The principal<br>
point of attack is in the back part of the small intestines, where<br>
considerable inflammation is set up, especially when there are other<br>
worms, such as the Roundworm, present.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Is of little value, as the worms in the intestines are very<br>
difficult to get at, but as their presence causes very little<br>
disturbance, it is hardly worth while treating; however, preventive<br>
measures should be applied by disinfecting, burning manure and bedding.<br>
<br>
The following has proven a very effective treatment for Pinworms:<br>
Powdered Quassia, one pound; Sulphur, two pounds; Glauber Salts, one<br>
pound; Powdered Tobacco, one-half pound; Sulphide of Antimony, one<br>
pound; Hyposulphite of Soda, two pounds; Beechwood Charcoal, one pound;<br>
Common Salt, two pounds.<br>
<br>
The above must be well powdered and thoroughly mixed. Give one heaping<br>
teaspoonful to everyone hundred pounds of hog weight.&nbsp; To small
pigs,<br>
give doses in proportion to weight. Place it in their feed or slop twice<br>
a day. In addition to being a vermifuge, it is an alterative and tonic<br>
that should be given pigs and hogs which do not thrive properly. Best<br>
results are obtained in treatment of Pinworm when the principal food<br>
consists of vegetables, mashes and slops.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
PLEURISY<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Exposure to cold, damp, chilly weather, especially to drafts, or<br>
by a large number of hogs being allowed to pile up during cold nights,<br>
etc.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Chilling, temperature elevated two or three degrees above<br>
normal; breathing fast. The hog will show great pain when pressed over<br>
the lungs by flinching, squealing or grunting; coughing suppressed, ribs<br>
rigid; breathing mostly with the muscles of the flanks; appetite poor<br>
and eventually there will be fluids accumulate in the lung cavities. At<br>
this stage, the breathing is labored and difficult. If the ear is<br>
pressed over the lungs, the fluids can be heard, and in the first stage<br>
the sound will be similar to that of rubbing hair between the finger and<br>
thumb.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Remove the cause. The treatment is satisfactory if applied in<br>
due time. Place in clean, comfortable shed, seeing that it is well<br>
ventilated, omit drafts; apply equal parts of Aqua Ammonia Fort.,<br>
Turpentine and Sweet Oil over the lungs and give two or four ounces of<br>
Castor Oil in milk. Feed easily digested food, such as hot wheat bran<br>
mashes, containing hog regulator and tonic as prescribed on first page<br>
of this chapter. It is also well to feed vegetables.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
RHEUMATISM<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Exposure, as in cold, damp houses. Overfeeding also has a<br>
tendency to cause swellings of the joints and muscles.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Lameness of one or more limbs, swelling of the joints about<br>
the legs and feet. The hog does not care to move, refusing its feed in<br>
most cases; temperature slightly elevated; breathing quick and short; he<br>
will drink water frequently if offered.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: I am of opinion that Rheumatism in hogs would be a very rare<br>
disease if they were properly provided with clean, dry quarters, with a<br>
liberal quantity of bedding. Do not allow hogs to pile up, as it is very<br>
injurious to them.<br>
<br>
MEDICAL TREATMENT: Consists of feeding sloppy food to which add one-half<br>
dram of Sodium Salicylate two or three times a day in their feed.<br>
Vegetables and green grass are very beneficial in this disease, as they<br>
have a cooling effect on the blood. The hog tonic and regulator<br>
recommended on first page of this chapter is very beneficial when given<br>
with food of a sloppy nature.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
RICKETS<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Food deficient in mineral matter or lime; filth, lack of<br>
exercise, and crowded quarters, all tend to produce a softening of the<br>
bones and swelling of the joints.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: The pigs affected generally appear in good condition and seem<br>
to be doing well, but suddenly they become paralyzed in the hind<br>
quarters, owing to the weakened condition of the bones, which sometimes<br>
fracture without receiving injury or any additional weight to that of<br>
the pig itself. The bones of the snout, back, limbs and feet bend and<br>
become deformed. The pigs grow weak, poor and stunted and perhaps the<br>
best treatment is to destroy them.<br>
<br>
PREVENTIVE TREATMENT: Careful feeding of good, wholesome food. This<br>
disease is very seldom seen where hogs are frequently fed corn.<br>
<br>
MEDICAL TREATMENT: When the first signs of Rickets appear, feed<br>
regulator and tonic as prescribed on first page of this chapter. It<br>
contains the mineral matter needed by the hog.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
ROUND WORMS<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Is undoubtedly due to filth or hogs eating food or drinking water<br>
contaminated with well developed eggs or embryos of roundworms, thus<br>
taking them into their digestive canal, where they multiply rapidly and<br>
set up considerable irritation. This worm varies in length from three to<br>
thirteen inches, and is of a reddish-brown color.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: The Roundworm is generally passed with the feces, and can be<br>
readily seen with the naked eye. A hog infested with a large number of<br>
these worms is generally restless, appetite varied. When these worms<br>
develop in large numbers, they obstruct the intestines. In other cases<br>
they irritate and inflame the intestines causing inflammation and<br>
diarrhoea, and death may be due to either obstruction or inflammation of<br>
the bowels.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Treatment is very satisfactory. Withhold all food from<br>
eighteen to twenty-four hours. Then place in one pint of finely ground<br>
feed, Calomel and Santonin, each five grains to every one hundred pounds<br>
of hog weight. For instance, if the hog affected with round worms weighs<br>
two hundred pounds, double the dose by giving ten grains of each of the<br>
above, but if the hog only weighs fifty pounds, give one-half the dose<br>
mentioned, or two and one-half grains of each. This treatment should be<br>
repeated in a week or ten days to assure the expulsion of worms that<br>
might have survived the first dose. Feed sparingly on laxative food, as<br>
bran mashes and vegetables, for a few days following each treatment.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
RUPTURE<br>
<br>
(Scrotal or Inguinal)<br>
<br>
DEFINITION: In the male the intestines pass through the wide Inguinal<br>
Canal, through which the cord of the testicle passes. It is not<br>
difficult to recognize this form of rupture, as the scrotum that<br>
normally retains only the testicles is usually enlarged by the bowels<br>
entering it. Sometimes the scrotum almost reaches the ground, and in<br>
this case, both sides of the scrotum, or the sack which contains the<br>
testicles, also contains intestines. If the pig is held up by the hind<br>
parts, the intestines will gravitate back into the abdominal cavity, but<br>
as soon as a pig lies down or stands they again return into the scrotum.<br>
The testicles can be located at the bottom of the enlargement.<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Hereditary tendencies predisposes them to rupture; pigs having<br>
large Inguinal Canals through which the testicle passes; by pigs being<br>
crowded, injured, squeezed at troughs, or passing through narrow<br>
doorways. Weakness and severe straining from constipation also produce<br>
rupture.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: An enlargement of the sack containing the testicles. Sometimes<br>
there may be a strangulation of the intestines where they fold or twist.<br>
They become inflamed and produce death. The pig dies in great pain, but<br>
fortunately, strangulated ruptures in pigs are very rare, as the scrotum<br>
and canal which the intestines occupy relax and become very roomy.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Operation is the only method of relieving or curing Inguinal<br>
or Scrotal Rupture. My advice is to operate as soon as possible. When<br>
the pigs are small, there is less danger. The pig to be operated on<br>
should be fasted for at least twenty-four hours, as it is easier on both<br>
the operator and pig when the intestines are empty, or nearly so.<br>
<br>
The operation which I have found to be very successful is as follows:<br>
Have an assistant hold the pig up by its hind legs. Prepare an<br>
antiseptic solution of Carbolic Acid five per cent, or Bichloride of<br>
Mercury, one in one-thousandths, in a pan. Have a needle threaded with a<br>
medium sized absorbent silk or cat-gut suture. Prepare a clean, sharp<br>
knife; wash the seat of operation with either antiseptic solution. Now,<br>
proceed to locate the testicle by having the hind parts elevated. The<br>
intestines must be pressed back into the abdominal cavity. The testicle<br>
will remain in the sack or scrotum; now grasp the testicle between the<br>
fingers and make the incision through the scrotum and to the lower<br>
portion. It may be necessary to insert two fingers to withdraw the<br>
testicle. When the testicle is located, withdraw it. Before cutting it<br>
off it is well to run a needle containing a thread through the last<br>
covering of the testicle so as to prevent the membrane from returning.<br>
After this is securely done, remove the testicle and sew the inner<br>
membranes that envelop the rupture and testicle with what is called a<br>
"tobacco pouch suture." Draw it together firmly and tie and cut off<br>
suture about one-half inch from the knot. Your operation is now<br>
complete. Do not sew the outer incision in the scrotum, as it would have<br>
a tendency to accumulate dirt and hold pus. It should have a free<br>
drainage. Wash with one of the above mentioned antiseptics twice daily<br>
until thoroughly healed. Also feed laxative foods that are easily<br>
digested.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
SORE FEET<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Filth; especially common in large hogs when confined to hard<br>
floors or driven over rough, hard roads, or continually kept in filthy<br>
pens. The tissues of the feet become softened, especially those between<br>
the claws. Irritation is set up by germs entering the abrasions.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: The hogs will be noticed going very lame and if closely<br>
examined the above named conditions will be found.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Remove the hogs to clean, dry pens containing plenty of clean<br>
bedding, and wash the affected parts with some good disinfectant, as<br>
five per cent solution of Carbolic Acid. Repeat this treatment at least<br>
once a day. In case the feet are badly inflamed, I would advise the<br>
application of hot Flaxseed Meal poultices to the feet. Feed easily<br>
digested food, as it aids materially in the treatment of infectious<br>
wounds.<br>

CHAMPION BERKSHIRE BOAR LONGFELLOW'S SUCCESSOR.<br>
Hood Farm, Lowell, Mass.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
SORE MOUTH<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Decomposed foods. Also slops or stagnant water, washing powders,<br>
broken glassware, etc., from the tables, fed in slops, barley or wheat<br>
beards, etc.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Difficulty in eating, or refusal to eat at all. Stringy<br>
secretions of saliva continually oozing from the mouth. The mouth gives<br>
off very offensive odor.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: In this form of sore mouth, remove the cause. Feed soft,<br>
wholesome food, such as wheat bran mashes and vegetables. In cases where<br>
it is due to the lodging of beards of wheat or barley, gag the hog's<br>
mouth with a piece of wood and remove the beards with forceps. Keep<br>
clean, cool water before them at all times and avoid feeding dry, hard<br>
food.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
SOWS EATING THEIR YOUNG<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Insufficient lime or mineral matter fed prior to farrowing;<br>
constipation is also a fruitful cause.<br>
<br>
PREVENTION: Careful feeding for a few days prior to farrowing of slops,<br>
free from soap or washing powders; cool food, such as wheat bran mashes,<br>
with hog tonic and regulator as prescribed on the first page of this<br>
chapter. This is loosening to the bowels and also contains mineral<br>
matter and blood purifiers which are very valuable in the above<br>
mentioned condition.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
SUN OR HEAT STROKE<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Hogs that are very fat, and driven, hauled or shipped to market<br>
when the weather is warm, are frequently stricken with heat or<br>
sun-stroke. Sometimes when hogs are overcrowded and not protected from<br>
the rays of the sun, or from heat, they may become victims of heat or<br>
sunstroke.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: First they stagger when walking, then they become very weak<br>
and temperature elevates three or four degrees higher than normal.<br>
Prostration or extreme depression, or sometimes involuntary spasms or<br>
contractions of muscles occur.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Prevention. Do not drive, haul or ship during the hottest<br>
part of the day, hogs that are not accustomed to exercise or extreme<br>
heat. Do not crowd hogs in small pens or sheds during the hot months, as<br>
their bodies give off considerable heat in addition to that of the sun.<br>
See that they are protected from the sun. When hauling or shipping hogs,<br>
wet them occasionally with water. It prevents heat stroke. In case a hog<br>
is suffering from heat or sun-stroke, place it in a cool, shady place<br>
and apply ice or cold water to the head only. Also give Saltpeter in<br>
teaspoonful doses every six hours diluted in one ounce of water. Also<br>
give Alcohol, one teaspoonful, every three hours in one ounce of water.<br>
Good recovery is often obtained from the above treatment.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
THORN-HEADED WORMS<br>
<br>
CAUSE: A white grub that is found in old manure heaps, straw stacks and<br>
hog lots carries eggs containing embryos of the Thorn-headed Worm. The<br>
white grub is eaten by the hog. The larvae of the Thorn-headed Worm is<br>
liberated by the process of digestion and becomes a parasite in the<br>
intestines of the hogs, where it develops into a fully matured worm.<br>
Large numbers of hogs quickly become infested with this parasite, as<br>
they multiply very rapidly. These worms vary from two to twelve inches<br>
in length, and have a whitish color.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: As a general rule, a worm can be seen in the feces. Other<br>
signs are that the hog loses flesh, appetite irregular, constipation,<br>
and then again there may be diarrhoea, especially where there are large<br>
numbers of worms present.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: First of all, burn all manure or decomposed vegetation that<br>
the hogs are liable to come in contact with. Withhold all food from<br>
eighteen to twenty-four hours and give one teaspoonful of Oil of<br>
Turpentine to everyone hundred pounds of hog weight, or if the hog<br>
weighs less than one hundred pounds, doses should be given in<br>
proportion. Follow this treatment for three or four consecutive days.<br>
Turpentine is easily given to hogs, as they will drink it in milk when<br>
well mixed. Perhaps it is advisable, where a large number of hogs are<br>
affected, to divide them into pens of five or ten hogs, as they are thus<br>
less likely to get an overdose. Feed laxative food. Clean and disinfect<br>
troughs and feeding floors. Also give prescription on first page of this<br>
chapter.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
THUMPS<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Disorders of the digestive system from overloading the stomach<br>
and causing irritation of the nerves leading to the diaphragm, which is<br>
the membrane that separates the lungs and heart from the intestines,<br>
stomach, liver and spleen. It is a spasm of this membrane that causes a<br>
hog or pig to have "Thumps." Insufficient exercise; a large number of<br>
pigs may become affected at the same time when closely confined.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Jerking of the flanks; the pig or hog becomes very weak and<br>
stunted in a very short time.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Remove the cause. In pigs, when first affected, careful<br>
feeding and exercise will generally effect a cure. In some cases, where<br>
the pigs are very small, it is well to take them away from the mother,<br>
permitting them to nurse very little. Give them Castor Oil in<br>
teaspoonful doses, and compel them to exercise. It may be necessary to<br>
give them Chloral Hydrate ten to fifteen grains two or three times a day<br>
diluted in a teaspoonful of water. Where the pigs will not eat mashes or<br>
drink milk, give them medicine by force with a teaspoon.<br>
<br>
AFTER TREATMENT: Give hog regulator and tonic as prescribed on first<br>
page of this chapter.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
WHIP WORM<br>
<br>
This worm is very uncommon, but occasionally is found in the large<br>
intestines.<br>
<br>
CAUSE: The eggs become imbedded in the manure, bedding, etc., and then<br>
mix with the feed and drinking water and are taken into the digestive<br>
canal where they develop into matured worms. This worm is from one to<br>
three inches in length, the hind extremity of which is very thin, hence<br>
the name, "Whipworm."<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: They produce very little disturbance, even though present in<br>
large quantities, except when other worms assist in their irritating the<br>
lining membranes of the large intestines.<br>
<br>
MEDICAL TREATMENT: Withhold all food from eighteen to twenty-four hours,<br>
then give one teaspoonful of Gasolene thoroughly mixed with milk, to<br>
everyone hundred pounds of hog weight. Small hogs, reduce the dose in<br>
proportion to their weight. It is advisable to follow this dose for two<br>
or three consecutive days. Feed food that is easily digested, and see<br>
that they have fresh water to drink.<br>

CHAPTER IV<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
ABORTION<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Is usually produced by injuries, or by the ewes being poisoned<br>
from eating poisonous foods, plants, etc. It has never occurred in<br>
infectious form in this country, although sometimes an outbreak is<br>
thought infectious on account of several ewes aborting about the same<br>
time, but all such outbreaks have been traced to some irritating poison<br>
which they had taken with their food or drinking water.<br>
<br>
PREVENTIVE TREATMENT: Remove the aborted lambs or kids and afterbirth<br>
from the yards, and also withdraw the ewe or nanny and place her in<br>
comfortable quarters. She requires care and extra nursing, or she will<br>
become very poor and lose a large portion of her fleece.<br>
<br>
MEDICAL TREATMENT: If due to poisonous plants, etc., when the first<br>
symptoms of Abortion or poisoning are noticed, give six to ten ounces of<br>
Castor Oil. Warm the oil so it will run freely. Set the sheep or goat<br>
upon its haunches and pour very slowly. Great care must be exercised so<br>
as not to let any of the oil enter the lungs, as it may produce fatal<br>
pneumonia. Feed food that is easily digested and supply them with pure<br>
water to drink. When the general condition is weak or run down, so to<br>
speak, the following tonic is recommended: Pulv. Gentian Root, one<br>
ounce; Pulv. Nux Vomica, one ounce; Pulv. Potassium Nitrate, one ounce;<br>
Hyposulphite of Soda, three ounces; Protan, three ounces. Mix and make<br>
into twenty-four powders. Give one powder two or three times daily well<br>
back on the tongue.<br>
<br>
REMEMBER all tonics are bitter, therefore beware of any so-called tonics<br>
that the animals eat readily as these possess no real tonic values.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
BLACK SCOURS<br>
<br>
(Verminous Gastritis--Strongylosis)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Due to a worm (Strongylus Contortus) measuring one-fourth to one<br>
inch in length, inhabiting the intestines and the fourth stomach of<br>
sheep and goats. This disease is frequently seen in low, marshy<br>
pastures, where animals infested with the worm pass the ova or egg with<br>
the feces, the eggs developing into an embryotic worm which is again<br>
taken with the food or water by non-infected animals, whereby this<br>
disease again attacks the intestines and fully matured worms develop.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Naturally, the symptoms vary according to the violence of the<br>
attack. In well developed cases, the animal strains to defecate, and<br>
passes shreds of intestinal mucous along with blood-stained feces.<br>
Finally a severe dysentery takes place, the animal becomes<br>
correspondingly weak, and death takes place in two or three days. Some<br>
cases become chronic, in which death does not take place for a month or<br>
more. However, the latter is uncommon. Other signs are staggering gait,<br>
trembling, eyes fixed, showing wild expression, neck turned to one side.<br>
Then the animal appears as if in pain, and looks around at the flank<br>
frequently. There is a chopping of the jaws, and a very free flow of<br>
stringy saliva dropping from the mouth. When an animal dies from the<br>
symptoms just described, it should be cut open and carefully examined<br>
for this particular parasite, which can be easily seen with the naked<br>
eye.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Very successfully treated when the first symptoms appear by<br>
administering one ounce of Gasolene with a pint of Milk. To lambs or<br>
kids give half the dose. Every precaution should be taken so as to<br>
prevent the drench from entering the lungs. Perhaps the best method is<br>
to set the animal on its haunches and pour the liquid slowly and<br>
carefully; if they cough, let them down. Any drench entering the lungs<br>
produces fatal pneumonia. Feed good nourishing food, and supply them<br>
with fresh water to drink.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CATARRH<br>
<br>
(Cold in the Head)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Atmospheric changes, sudden exposure to cold, wet weather after<br>
being accustomed to warm, comfortable surroundings, inhaling dust, smoke<br>
and gases or, in fact, anything that will produce an irritation to the<br>
membranes lining the nose; commonly seen in the spring and fall.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Chilling, elevation of temperature, nose dry, breathing<br>
hurried, sneezing, coughing, dullness, appetite varied. In the first<br>
stages of the malady, the nostrils are considerably inflamed, but in the<br>
course of a few days the temperature subsides and a yellowish-white<br>
discharge flows from the nose continuously.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Keep the affected animals dry, omit drafts, feed good,<br>
wholesome food, and provide bedding for them to lie upon. In the first<br>
stages of this malady, it is advisable to confine the animals in a barn,<br>
closing the windows and doors and compelling them to inhale steam from<br>
boiling hot water and Pine Tar. The best method to accomplish this is by<br>
placing a tub about half full of water in the center of the barn and add<br>
about one gallon of Pine Tar. Then heat bricks or stones and place them<br>
into the tub. In this way a large number can be treated at one time. The<br>
sheep should be compelled to inhale this steam for thirty to forty<br>
minutes twice a day. In addition to the above, the following is very<br>
beneficial: Chlorate of Potash, one ounce; Nitrate of Potassi, two<br>
ounces. Make into sixteen powders and give one powder to each sheep in<br>
its drinking water two or three times daily. Feed hot bran mashes and<br>
vegetables if possible.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
DIARRHOEA<br>
<br>
(Dysentery)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Diarrhoea, or Dysentery, is a sign of some irritation of the<br>
intestines resulting in increased secretions, or increased muscular<br>
contraction, or both. The irritation is sometimes the result of chilling<br>
from exposure, improper feeding, as contaminated or frozen foods,<br>
irritating foods, drinking cold or stagnant water, indigestion, organic<br>
diseases of the intestines, or parasitic diseases. (See Strongylosis.)<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Movements from the bowels are frequent, at first consisting of<br>
thin fecal matter, but as this malady progresses it becomes watery and<br>
offensive in smell, and streaked with blood. At first the animal shows<br>
no constitutional disturbances, but eventually it becomes weak and shows<br>
signs of abdominal pain by looking around to the flank, throwing the<br>
feet together, lying down, or moving restlessly. Sometimes this disease<br>
is accompanied by fever, great depression, loss of strength, rapid loss<br>
of flesh; terminating in death.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Determine the cause and remove it if possible. When the<br>
disease is due to irritating properties of food which have been fed the<br>
animal, it is well to give a physic of Castor Oil in two to six ounce<br>
doses, according to the size of the animal. When there is debility, want<br>
of appetite, and temperature normal, but continuous water discharge from<br>
the bowels, give Protan, two ounces; Gum Catechu, one ounce; Pulv.<br>
Ginger, one ounce; Zinc Sulphocarbolates, eight grains. Make into<br>
sixteen powders and give one powder on the tongue every three or four<br>
hours, according to the severity of the attack. Feed food that is easily<br>
digested, as wheat bran mashes, steamed rolled oats, etc. See that the<br>
drinking water is fresh and clean.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
FOOT ROT<br>
<br>
(Foul in the Foot)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Foot Rot is produced by inflammation of the soft structures of<br>
the foot between the claws or toes. It may be due to an overgrowth and<br>
inward pressure, etc., or from filth accumulating and hardening between<br>
the claws, producing inflammation and softening or ulceration of the<br>
skin in the interdigital space (between the claws). Under some<br>
conditions several sheep or goats in the same drove become affected at<br>
the same time, leading many to think that the disease is contagious.<br>
When Foot Rot appears in a very short time, among sheep or goats, this<br>
condition can almost always be traced to filth, irritation, etc.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: The animal is observed to limp when walking. On careful<br>
examination of the foot we find it hot, swollen above the claws and in<br>
the soft parts between them, frequently spreading the claws apart to a<br>
considerable extent, or the inflammation may have advanced to softening<br>
and sloughing of the soft structure between the claws. If this condition<br>
is neglected at this stage, deep abscesses form and the pus burrows<br>
under the horny wall, and the joints within the hoof become inflamed and<br>
destroyed, in which case the treatment is difficult and recovery will be<br>
very arduous.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: In the early stages of the disease, before the pus burrows<br>
beneath the horny structures of the foot, any foreign substances<br>
impacted between the claws should be removed. Then place a trough about<br>
one foot wide, six to eight inches high, and twelve to sixteen feet<br>
long, and fill with water and Coal Tar Dip, diluted in proportions of<br>
one part dip to fifty parts of water. Build a fence on each side of the<br>
trough, just wide enough for one sheep to pass through, and compel every<br>
sheep to walk through the solution slowly.<br>
<br>
This treatment should be repeated once or twice a week until the<br>
lameness has disappeared. In cases where deep sloughing has taken place<br>
under the horny structures, saturate a piece of oakum or cotton in the<br>
following liniment: Oil of Origanum, Oil of Pisis, Oil of Turpentine,<br>
each four ounces. Place it between the claws and hold it there by means<br>
of a bandage. Repeat this application every other day. The animals that<br>
do not show signs of improvement under this treatment in a few days<br>
invariably have the joints of the foot affected and should not be<br>
driven.<br>

DELAINE MERINO RAM AND EWES.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
FORAGE POISONING<br>
<br>
CAUSE: This condition is produced by animals eating various foliage<br>
(Grass or Shrubbery) at a time when the peculiar poisonous principles<br>
are developed in it, as appears to happen in certain seasons. The<br>
disease is liable to affect a large proportion of animals which are<br>
under the same grazing conditions.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Generally takes two or three days to develop. The animal<br>
gradually becomes more or less unconscious and paralyzed, staggers when<br>
forced to walk, and it may have great difficulty in keeping on its feet,<br>
it is extremely averse to going down, and leans for support against any<br>
convenient object. It breathes in a snorting manner. The mucous<br>
membranes are tinged with yellow, and the bowels constipated. In other<br>
cases severe diarrhoea follows, and the animal becomes very weak and<br>
dies in convulsions or spasms. Recovery may be expected in cases that<br>
are not marked by severe symptoms.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Endeavor to find out the true cause and remove it if<br>
possible. Change range or pasture for a short time; this has<br>
successfully eradicated this malady. The animal showing the above<br>
symptoms should receive four to eight ounces of Castor Oil regardless of<br>
whether there is diarrhoea or constipation. In either case the<br>
irritation will be relieved by its laxative effect. In cases where<br>
diarrhoea becomes chronic, after administering the Castor Oil, the<br>
following will be found very efficient in its control: Protan, three<br>
ounces; Ginger, one ounce; Gum Catechu, two ounces. Make into sixteen<br>
powders and place one powder well back on the tongue every four or six<br>
hours. Feed clean, wholesome food and supply clean, fresh water to<br>
drink. Provide shelter for the animal if the weather is hot.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
GARGET<br>
<br>
(Congestion and Inflammation of the Udder)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: As a rule, in Garget or Congestion of the Udder in heavy milking<br>
ewes, just before and after lambing, the glands of the udder enlarge,<br>
become hot, tense and tender and a slight pasty swelling extends forward<br>
from the glands on the lower surface of the abdomen. This physiological<br>
condition is looked upon as a matter of course and disposed of in two or<br>
three days when the secretions of milk have been fully established.<br>
General breaking up of the udder may be greatly hastened by the sucking<br>
of a hungry lamb and the kneading it gives the udder with its nose is<br>
beneficial. The above mentioned congestion or Garget may emerge into<br>
active inflammation resulting from continued exposure to cold weather,<br>
standing in cold drafts or injury to the udder from stone, clubs, feet<br>
of other animals, overfeeding or rich food, like cotton seed or soy<br>
bean, sore teats or a ewe losing her lamb in the period of full milking;<br>
serious disturbances of the animal's health is liable to fall upon the<br>
udder.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: The symptoms and mode of attack vary in different cases.<br>
Following exposure to cold drafts or cold, wet weather, there is usually<br>
severe chilling with cold ears and limbs and general dryness and<br>
brittleness of the wool. This is followed by a flush of heat, the ears<br>
and limbs become unnaturally warm and the glands swell up and become<br>
firm and solid in one or both sides of the udder. The muzzle is hot and<br>
dry, temperature elevated two or three degrees above normal, pulse firm<br>
and quick, excited breathing, appetite and rumination suspended, bowels<br>
constipated, urine scanty and the yield of milk may be entirely<br>
suppressed in the affected side.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Determine the cause and remove it if possible. Move the<br>
affected animal to comfortable quarters, supply liberal quantifies of<br>
bedding for the animal to lie upon. Give two to six ounces of Glauber<br>
Salts dissolved in a pint of hot water. Permit it to cool. Place the ewe<br>
on her haunches and drench carefully. Feed laxative foods as hot bran<br>
mashes, steamed rolled oats and vegetables, supplying the animal with<br>
pure water to drink, to which add two drams of Hyposulphite of Soda, two<br>
or three times a day. In some cases it is advisable to apply Camphorated<br>
Ointment to the udder once or twice a day.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
GID<br>
<br>
(Sturdy)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Gid is produced by a bladder worm, a larva or an egg of the<br>
tapeworm infesting the intestines of dogs, wolves and coyotes. The eggs<br>
of these tapeworms are scattered over the range or pastures in the<br>
droppings of infested dogs, wolves or coyotes, and these when swallowed<br>
in the food or water by the sheep, hatch out and the embryos migrate to<br>
the brain, spinal cord, etc., where they develop into cysts, bladder<br>
worms or water bags, etc. When the organs of sheep, thus infested, are<br>
eaten by dogs, wolves or coyotes, the cyst worms are also likely to be<br>
swallowed and then develop into mature tapeworms.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: In case a large number of embryos become lodged in the brain<br>
of sheep, the first signs will be shown in about eight to twelve days.<br>
Bladder worms produce a congestion of the brain which causes dullness,<br>
dizziness, indicating an affection of the brain, walking or turning in<br>
circles. If the left side of the brain is affected they will turn to the<br>
left; if the right side is affected, they will turn to the right. The<br>
head eventually droops, the eyes become red and the vision is impaired,<br>
the head very hot over the affected region, the affected sheep become<br>
separated from the flock. Sometimes the sheep are partially or<br>
completely paralyzed.<br>
<br>
PREVENTION: Prevention is the only method by which this disease can be<br>
eradicated. Prevent the sheep from becoming infected with these<br>
parasites. Stray dogs, wolves or coyotes should be killed whenever<br>
found, and dogs too valuable to kill should be kept free from tapeworm.<br>
Meat should not be fed to dogs unless cooked or known to be free from<br>
tapeworm cysts.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
GRUBS IN THE HEAD<br>
<br>
(Head Maggot)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Grubs in the head of sheep are produced by the Sheep Gadfly which<br>
is yellowish-gray in color with five well divided rings around its body,<br>
covered over with fine hair and the lower portion of the head white.<br>
This fly is somewhat larger than the ordinary house fly. It attacks<br>
sheep and goats during the Summer and Fall and deposits its larva about<br>
the sheep's and goat's nostrils. This larva attaches itself to the<br>
mucous membrane of the nostrils with two hooklets by which it gradually<br>
works into the air cavities of the head, remaining there for about ten<br>
months. Then it again passes from the nostrils, burrows into the ground<br>
and becomes a fully matured Gadfly in six or eight weeks, which<br>
completes its life cycle, the head of the sheep or goat being its<br>
intermediate host where the newly born Gadfly again attaches its larva.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: When sheep or goats are attacked by this Gadfly, they run,<br>
strike at the nose with their front feet, rub the nose on the ground or<br>
against other sheep. In case only three or four larvae gain entrance to<br>
the sinuses of the head, they produce very little, if any, ill effects,<br>
but where they become numerous, they cause the animal to cough and<br>
sneeze continually, discharge from the nose, which is occasionally<br>
tinged with blood. The appetite becomes impaired, the animal shows signs<br>
of emaciation, becomes very weak, raises the nose in the air, but<br>
eventually becomes so weak it reels when walking and finally lies down.<br>
It becomes so weak it cannot toss the head or rise, and dies.<br>
<br>
PREVENTION TREATMENT: Very successful. Paint the sheep's or goat's nose<br>
with Pine Tar, or better still, place salt in a trough, covering it with<br>
boards, with holes bored in them just large enough for the animal to<br>
insert its nose. Smear Pine Tar about the holes once or twice a week.<br>
This treatment has proven very efficient in localities where sheep<br>
Gadflies are numerous.<br>
<br>
MEDICAL TREATMENT: After the animal once becomes infected with these<br>
grubs, bore holes (trephine) through the skull with a sharp instrument<br>
made for this purpose and remove the grubs. This requires considerable<br>
amount of skill and should be attempted only by a competent<br>
Veterinarian.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
HOVEN<br>
<br>
(Bloating--Acute Tynpanitis--Acute Indigestion)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Hoven is caused by various kinds of food which produce<br>
indigestion or fermentation and resultant gases in the rumen or paunch.<br>
When sheep are first turned into young clover, they eat so greedily of<br>
it that bloating frequently results. Turnips, potatoes and cabbage may<br>
also produce it. Middlings and corn meal also frequently give rise to<br>
it. In this connection it may be stated that an excessive quantity of<br>
any food, before mentioned, may bring on this disorder, or it may not be<br>
due to excessive eating but to eating too fast. Sometimes the quality of<br>
food is at fault. Grass, clover or alfalfa, when wet with dew or rain<br>
soaked, frequently produce digestive disorders and bloating follows.<br>
Frozen roots or potatoes covered with white frost should be regarded as<br>
dangerous. When food has been eaten too hastily or when it is cold and<br>
wet, the digestive process is imperfectly performed and the food<br>
contained in the paunch ferments, during which process large quantities<br>
of gas are formed. This same result may follow when a sheep is choking,<br>
as the obstruction in the gullet prevents the eructation or passing of<br>
gas from the stomach so that the gas continues to accumulate until<br>
severe bloating results.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: The swelling of the left flank is very characteristic, as in<br>
well marked cases the flank at its upper part rises above the level of<br>
the backbone and when struck with the tips of the fingers emits a<br>
drum-like sound. The animal has an anxious expression, moves uneasily<br>
and is evidently distressed. If relief is not obtained in time the sheep<br>
breathes with difficulty, reels in walking or standing and in a short<br>
time falls down and dies from suffocation. The distention of the stomach<br>
or rumen may become so great that it pushes the diaphragm (the membrane<br>
separating the lung and intestinal cavity) forward against the lungs, so<br>
as to squeeze and stop their movements, thus preventing the animal from<br>
breathing and in some instances the case may be complicated by a rupture<br>
of the stomach.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Do not waste any time. Puncture about three inches downward<br>
and forward from the point of the hip bone with a clean sharp knife, or<br>
any instrument that is clean and sharp. A special instrument made for<br>
this purpose, the trocar, is a very useful instrument on the farm.<br>
<br>
Sometimes bloating becomes chronic, and if such is the case dissolve two<br>
teaspoonfuls of Turpentine in one-half pint of milk and drench the<br>
animal very carefully, as some of this drench may escape into the lungs<br>
and produce fatal pneumonia. Set a sheep upon its haunches to give the<br>
medicine; if it coughs let it down quickly to prevent strangulation.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
INDIGESTION<br>
<br>
(Dyspepsia)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Irritant food, damaged food, overloaded paunch or sudden change<br>
of diet may produce this disease. Want of exercise predisposes an animal<br>
to it and it is caused by woody or indigestible food. Food which<br>
possesses astringent (drying) properties tends to check the digestive<br>
secretions and may also act as an exciting cause. Food in excessive<br>
quantity may lead to disorders of the digestion and to this disease. It<br>
is very likely to appear towards the end of the protracted season of<br>
draught, therefore a deficiency of water must be regarded as one of the<br>
conditions which favors its development.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Appetite diminished; rumination, or chewing the cud,<br>
irregular; tongue coated, mouth slimy, feces passed apparently not well<br>
digested and offensive in odor, dullness and fullness of the flanks.<br>
This disease may, in some cases, assume a chronic character, for in<br>
addition to the above mentioned symptoms, slight bloating of the left<br>
flank may be observed. The animal breathes with great difficulty and<br>
grunts with each respiration. The ears and legs alternately become hot<br>
and cold. The rumination, or cud chewing, at this stage ceases and the<br>
usual rumbling sound in the stomach is not audible. The passage of feces<br>
is entirely suspended and the animal passes only a little mucus<br>
occasionally. Sometimes constipation and diarrhoea alternate; there is a<br>
rise in temperature in many cases. The disease continues for a few days<br>
or a week in this mild form, while the severe form of the disease may<br>
last for several weeks. In the severe form the emaciation and loss of<br>
strength may be very great. There is no appetite, no rumination or<br>
rumbling sound in the stomach or intestines. The mouth is hot and<br>
sticky, the eyes have retracted in their sockets and the milk secretion<br>
has ceased. In such cases the outlook for recovery is unfavorable. The<br>
affected animals fall away in flesh and become very weak, which is shown<br>
by the fact that one finds the animal lying down.<br>
<br>
On examination of sheep or goats which have died of this disease, it is<br>
found that the lining membranes of the fourth stomach and intestines,<br>
particularly the small intestines, are red, swollen, streaked with deep<br>
red or blushed lines or spotted. The lining of the third stomach is more<br>
or less softened and may be easily pealed off. The third stomach<br>
contains dry, hard food masses, closely adhering to its walls. In some<br>
cases the brain appears to become affected, probably from the pain<br>
endured and weakness and absorption of poisons generated in the<br>
digestive canal. In such cases there is weakness and a staggering gait;<br>
the sheep or goats do not appear to see, and will consequently run<br>
against obstacles. After a time it falls down and gives up to a violent<br>
disordered struggle. This delirious condition is succeeded by stupor and<br>
death.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Successful; if fed in its first stages on small quantities of<br>
roots, sweet silage or select grasses or hay. This should be offered<br>
several times daily. Very little food should be allowed if the animal is<br>
constipated, in which case give two to four ounces of Glauber Salts<br>
dissolved in a pint of hot water. When it cools, set the animal on its<br>
haunches and pour slowly and carefully. If they strangle or cough let<br>
them down, as some of the drench may escape into the lungs and produce<br>
lung complications. After the Glauber Salts have acted and if there is a<br>
lack of appetite and the animal does not chew the cud regularly, the<br>
following tonic will be found beneficial: Pulv. Gentian Root, one ounce;<br>
Pulv. Nux Vomica, one ounce; Pulv. Anise Seed, two ounces. Mix<br>
thoroughly and make into thirty-two powders. Give one powder two or<br>
three times a day well back on the tongue. The food must be rather<br>
laxative and of a digestible character. After an attack of this form of<br>
indigestion, ice cold water should be avoided. Food should be given in<br>
moderate quantities, as any excess by overtaxing the digestive functions<br>
may bring on a relapse.<br>

CHAMPION SHROPSHIRE RAM.<br>
Owned by McKerrow &amp; Son, Pewaukee, Wis.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
JAUNDICE<br>
<br>
(Liver Congestion--Inflammation of the Liver)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Jaundice or Liver Congestion is due to constipation where there<br>
is an inactive or torpid condition of the bowels and the bile which<br>
passes into the intestines is absorbed and produces a yellow staining of<br>
Jaundice. Jaundice is merely a symptom of a disease and ought to direct<br>
attention to ascertain if possible the cause or causes which give rise<br>
to it. Inflammation of the liver usually occurs as a complication of<br>
infectious diseases. It may also occur as a complication of intestinal<br>
catarrh, or in hot weather from overheating, eating decomposed or<br>
irritating food or from drinking stagnant water.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: The signs are sometimes obscure and their real significance is<br>
frequently overlooked. The most prominent symptoms are the yellowness of<br>
the white of the eyes and of the mucous membranes lining the mouth,<br>
appetite poor, body presents an emaciated appearance, the feces is light<br>
in color, while the urine is likely to be unusually dark and there is<br>
great thirst present. The gait is weak and the animal lies down more<br>
than usual and while doing so frequently has its head around resting on<br>
the side of its chest. Temperature is slightly elevated above normal and<br>
breathing is somewhat hurried.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Remove the cause if possible. Give Glauber Salts in three to<br>
four ounce doses, diluted in a pint of hot water permitted to cool and<br>
give at one dose. When drenching be very careful, as some of the liquid<br>
may escape into the lungs and produce severe complications. Feed green<br>
food or hot bran mashes and supply them with a liberal quantity of pure<br>
water to drink.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
LIVER FLUKE<br>
<br>
CAUSE: The parasite that produces Liver Fluke in sheep has an oblong,<br>
flat, leaf-like body, brownish in color, measuring from one-fourth to<br>
one-half inch in length. Sheep become infected with this Liver Fluke<br>
from grazing on low marshy pastures infected by the larvae of Liver<br>
Fluke.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: A sheep, when first infected with Liver Fluke, generally<br>
thrives as the parasites tend to stimulate the process of digestion,<br>
being located as they are in the liver, but eventually rumination<br>
becomes irregular, the sheep becomes anemic, weak and the visible mucous<br>
membranes of the mouth, nose and eyes become pale, bloodless, taking on<br>
a yellowish color as the disease progresses. Swellings will also appear<br>
under the jaw along the neck and under the lung cavity. The process of<br>
breathing becomes feeble and temperature irregular. Pregnant ewes will<br>
generally abort and nursing ewes' milk will become so deprived of its<br>
nourishing properties that the lambs become emaciated, although not<br>
necessarily affected with the Liver Fluke.<br>
<br>
PREVENTION: Move to non-infected pastures, supply the animals grazing on<br>
low marshy pastures with a liberal amount of salt, also introduce frogs,<br>
toads, carp, etc., into the marshy ponds, as they destroy the parasite<br>
in its first stages of development, feeding on their intermediate host,<br>
the snail.<br>
<br>
MEDICAL TREATMENT: This is of little value. After an animal once becomes<br>
infected with the parasite, it never makes a complete recovery, although<br>
Calomel administered in ten grain doses every two or three weeks appears<br>
to have a very good effect in some cases, if fed freely on nitrogenous<br>
food and permitted to drink well of pure running water.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
LUNG FEVER<br>
<br>
(Pneumonia--Congestion of the Lungs--Pulmonary Apoplexy)<br>
<br>
Acute congestion and inflammation of the spongy tissues of the lungs is<br>
frequently seen in sheep, the same as in other animals.<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Sheep that are over driven are subject to Lung Congestion in<br>
acute or chronic form and sometimes Pulmonary Apoplexy, and especially<br>
when in a plethoric condition are predisposed to inflammation of the<br>
lungs. The exciting cause is very much the same as in different diseases<br>
of the air passage and it is not uncommon for the inflammation to extend<br>
from these parts of the lungs. However, there are a number of causes in<br>
addition to those already mentioned. It frequently results when sheep<br>
are accustomed to warm, comfortable quarters and are changed to cold,<br>
drafty pens, or shipping some distance in open stock cars during cold<br>
weather. In fact, any sudden chilling of the body is a common cause of<br>
lung disorders. Giving fat sheep too much exercise when they are not<br>
accustomed to it is a very frequent cause of Congestion and Inflammation<br>
of the Lungs. This may occur when they are chased by dogs, etc., or when<br>
driven to a distant market at too rapid a gait. Exercise during the hot<br>
summer months is apt to cause congestion of the lung substance, as well<br>
as heat stroke. Dipping sheep during cold weather may chill the body and<br>
result in this disease.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: If due to severe exercise, the animal appears greatly<br>
exhausted and the Congestion of the Lungs is marked. Death may occur in<br>
this stage of the disease. Inflammation of the Lungs usually begins with<br>
a chill and is followed by a high fever. The sheep stand most of the<br>
time and may eat nothing, or very little. The breathing is hurried at<br>
first, but when the lungs become badly involved, it is also labored. The<br>
character of the pulse beats varies, depending on the extent of the<br>
inflammation and the stage of the disease. In most cases the pulse is<br>
full and quick during the early stages of the disease. A very weak pulse<br>
is present in severe and fatal cases of Pneumonia. The visible mucous<br>
membranes have a red colored appearance and there may be a slight<br>
discharge from the nostrils. The expression of the face is anxious and<br>
distressed in severe cases and rigors and chilling of the body occur.<br>
The respiratory sounds are more or less normal. The cough at first is<br>
deep and dry; later it becomes loose and moist. It may be accompanied by<br>
a hemorrhage during this stage of the disease. Other respiratory sounds<br>
are revealed by placing the ear to the side of the chest walls and<br>
listening to the sound of the lungs. This cannot be practiced in long<br>
wooled sheep with satisfaction, as the chest walls are so thick that the<br>
lung sounds are deadened, or the noise made by the animal hides the<br>
respiratory murmurs in the very early stages of Inflammation of the<br>
Lungs. A crepitating or crackling sound can be heard in the diseased<br>
parts and louder sounds than normal in the healthy areas. Later when the<br>
engorgement of the lung substance occurs and the air cells become filled<br>
with an inflammatory serum, the respiratory sounds are deadened, but on<br>
returning to the normal, a rattling sound occurs. These symptoms help<br>
greatly in determining the animal's condition and in watching the<br>
progress of the disease. The chances for the recovery depend on the<br>
extent and the acuteness of the inflammation. Careless handling,<br>
exercising, etc., lessen the chances for a favorable termination in the<br>
disease, but good care helps more to bring about recovery than the<br>
medical treatment. The recovery is more unfavorable in fat than in lean<br>
sheep, as the inflammation is usually more severe in the former. The<br>
course is from seven to twenty-one days and it may become chronic if<br>
the irritation is kept up. In such cases, unthriftiness is a prominent<br>
sign.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: The preventive treatment in Pneumonia must not be overlooked.<br>
Briefly, it consists in avoiding such conditions as may predispose the<br>
animal to the disease or act in any way as an exciting cause. Careful<br>
nursing is a very important part of the treatment. The sheep should be<br>
given a comfortable, well ventilated shed and kept as quiet as possible.<br>
If the bowels become constipated, give two or three ounces of Castor Oil<br>
and feed sloppy food. As one attack predisposes the sheep to a second,<br>
it should be protected from severe cold, or the other extreme, heat, for<br>
a month after making a complete recovery.<br>
<br>
The following prescription will be found very beneficial: Iodide of<br>
Ammonia, one-half ounce; Chlorate of Potassi, one ounce; Pulv. Nux<br>
Vomica, one ounce. Make into twenty-four powders and give one powder<br>
every four hours well back on the tongue. Continue this treatment until<br>
the animal has recovered.<br>

<br>
LUNG WORMS, LAMB DISEASE<br>
<br>
(Verminous Bronchitis)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Due to a white thread-like worm (Strongylus Filaria) varying in<br>
length from one to three inches. These worms affect and live in the<br>
trachea (windpipe) and bronchial tubes. Infected animals, in coughing,<br>
expel fertilized eggs which develop on the grass and stagnant water. The<br>
larvae are again taken up either in the drinking water or in eating<br>
grass or hay gathered on low marshy soil. Warm wet weather favors their<br>
development.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: This worm is liable to attack a number of animals at the same<br>
time. The weakest sheep and young lambs are the first to show signs by<br>
coughing forcibly, distressing, hacking and convulsive in character. A<br>
stringy mucus is sometimes expelled during the spasm of coughing. This<br>
mucus contains worms which can be detected, or their ova observed under<br>
a magnifying glass. In the latter stages of the disease, they cough<br>
severely at night. These attacks have a sub-acute character and prove<br>
very exhausting. The parasite by becoming entwined in balls severely<br>
affects the animal's breathing which is always remarkably labored in the<br>
latter stages of the disease. The animal refuses to eat, becomes<br>
emaciated, anemic, mucous membranes of the eyes, mouth and nose become<br>
very pale and the sheep die in convulsions from suffocation.<br>
<br>
PREVENTIVE TREATMENT: Avoid grazing your sheep on low marshy soil,<br>
especially during warm wet weather. Young lambs and weak ewes are<br>
especially susceptible to this disease.<br>
<br>
MEDICAL TREATMENT: The writer has tried various treatments as fumigation<br>
with different substances and injection of remedies into the windpipe by<br>
the use of a hypodermic syringe, etc., but none have proven very<br>
successful, from a practical standpoint. I would recommend placing the<br>
affected animals in a tightly closed barn or shed, in the center of<br>
which place a pan of red hot coals and cover with Sulphur.<br>
<br>
A person should remain in the barn or shed as long as he possibly can<br>
and after the fumes become so irritating that he cannot endure them any<br>
longer, he should immediately make his exit. The sheep should be<br>
compelled to stay a minute or two longer and then quickly open the doors<br>
and windows. Repeat this treatment once or twice a week. Feed affected<br>
animals well. Give them fresh water to drink and protect them from<br>
exposure. This treatment, as above described, has given very good<br>
results, providing the parasites were not too numerous.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
SCAB<br>
<br>
(Mange)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: The mange mite (Psoroptes Communis). This parasite is equipped<br>
with stylets which pierce the skin at the seat where the mange mite<br>
penetrates the skin, and produces small red spots followed by a blister<br>
filled with serum, which ruptures, the serum drying and forming a small<br>
scab. It is in this way that innumerable mange mites cause the piling up<br>
of scabs thus producing a very scaly condition. As Mange advances, the<br>
scaly patches eventually pile up until they attain the thickness of<br>
one-half inch, unless these scabs have been severely rubbed.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Very easily detected, as a bunch of sheep that have been<br>
recently infected will be uneasy or restless, rubbing, against fences,<br>
posts, brush, etc., causing bunches of wool to loosen. The itching seems<br>
to be more intense at night and during warm weather. The affected<br>
animals will even make attempts to bite themselves, due to the agony<br>
produced by the mange mite. If the skin is examined by the aid of a<br>
magnifying glass, the mange mite can be easily noticed, or by scraping<br>
the skin with a knife and placing the scabs on a dark paper and exposed<br>
to the warmth of the sun, the mange mite moving about can readily be<br>
seen with the naked eye. Mangy sheep become very poor and eventually<br>
die.<br>
<br>
PREVENTION: This is important, for although the disease is treated with<br>
very good results, the mange mite annoy the sheep until they become very<br>
weak and emaciated and the loss of wool is enormous due to the affected<br>
animal continually rubbing against fences, brush, etc.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Consists of using various dips, as Lime and Sulphur, which is<br>
recommended by the United States Bureau of Animal Industry. This is very<br>
effective and inexpensive. Scabby sheep should be dipped a week or ten<br>
days after shearing; two dippings are necessary at the interval of ten<br>
days. After dipping, move to non-infected range or pastures.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
TICK<br>
<br>
(Louse Fly)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: The tick that infects sheep has a very small head sunken into its<br>
round body. The head possesses a flexible trunk or snout that penetrates<br>
the skin. Through this trunk, the ticks derive their nourishment by<br>
sucking the blood from the body of the sheep.&nbsp; The tick is also
provided<br>
with three pairs of legs. The female lays her young in the form of a<br>
spun egg (cocoon) which is oblong in shape and brown in color. This egg<br>
is cemented to the wool of sheep where young ticks are hatched in about<br>
four to six weeks.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Long wooled sheep are more susceptible to this tick as their<br>
wool provides shelter for both the tick and its eggs. After shearing the<br>
sheep the ticks have a tendency to leave the body and to migrate to the<br>
legs or to unshorn lambs where their snouts or trunks pierce the skin<br>
which appears to become infected, producing a swelling and inflammation.<br>
The infected sheep run, scratch and bite themselves. When these ticks<br>
become developed in large quantities, they produce a paleness of the<br>
mucous membranes of the eyes, mouth and nose, as the ticks suck large<br>
quantities of blood, which produces an anemic condition. The sheep<br>
become poor, weak and unthrifty.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Satisfactorily treated by dipping infected sheep in Coal Tar<br>
dips or Emulsions of Crude Petroleum. Shearing the sheep has a good<br>
effect, but care must be exercised as the ticks then rapidly migrate to<br>
the lambs.<br>

CHAPTER V<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
AIR SAC MITE<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Produced by a parasite called Cylodites Nudus, which bears a<br>
close resemblance to the parasite causing mange or scabies in the<br>
domesticated animal. Owing to the peculiar construction of their<br>
breathing organs fowls are more susceptible to parasites than animals.<br>
In addition to affecting the lungs, the Air Sac Mite may extend its<br>
operations to the intestines, kidneys, liver and bones.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Unthriftiness is first noticed, but after the parasites become<br>
numerous, the fowl shows signs of difficult breathing, perhaps<br>
terminating in bronchial pneumonia. In some cases death occurs without<br>
apparent cause. The bird will be inactive, becomes separated from the<br>
rest of the flock, comb pale, head drawn close to the body, wings hang<br>
pendulous, lose flesh, breathing becomes hard, coughing, sneezing and a<br>
rattling from the mucus in the windpipe is heard. Death is produced from<br>
suffocation.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Separate the sick from the healthy fowls. Disinfect coops and<br>
runways of both sick and healthy birds with Crude Carbolic Acid,<br>
undiluted. Also fumigate the fowls in their coops with steam from hot<br>
water and Pine Tar. This may be done by placing the water and Tar in a<br>
pan and then inserting a hot stone or brick in the solution. This<br>
perhaps is the simplest method of fumigation. Also mix Sulphur in their<br>
feed regularly.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
APOPLEXY<br>
<br>
(Hemorrhage of the Brain)<br>
<br>
Due to the rupture of a blood vessel of the brain and pressure from the<br>
escaping blood.<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Mechanical injuries, straining when laying eggs (hens are<br>
frequently found dead on the nest from this cause), overfeeding,<br>
stimulating food, etc., all tend to produce apoplexy.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Appear very suddenly, bird is seen to walk unsteadily, falls,<br>
or perhaps is found dead.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: In mild attacks, apply cold water or ice to fowl's head until<br>
thoroughly cooled. Give one-half grain of Calomel, feed soft food,<br>
compel the bird to exercise. Owing to the loss of blood a tonic will be<br>
necessary. Pulv. Gentian Root, Pulv. Saltpeter, Capsicum and Ferri<br>
Sulphate (Pulv.) equal parts one ounce. Mix and place one teaspoonful in<br>
feed for every twenty-five fowls. This tonic purifies and builds up the<br>
blood, just what is needed in this particular condition.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
BALDNESS<br>
<br>
(Favus)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Due to fungi.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: The first noticeable sign is the whitish appearance of the<br>
comb due to gray spots about the size of a pin head. As the disease<br>
progresses, this condition spreads to other parts of the body; the<br>
feathers look rough and dry and break easily. The fowl grows weaker,<br>
refuses to eat and if not properly treated, dies.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Remove the scabs by separating the feathers and using a<br>
brush. Apply Sulphur Ointment. Repeat this treatment after two or three<br>
days. Great care must be taken to prevent the fowl from chilling or<br>
taking cold.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
BEAK AND THROAT OBSTRUCTION<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Lodgment in the beak or food canal of a foreign substance, such<br>
as a kernel of corn, sunflower seed, bone, etc.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Fowl jerks its head suddenly and frequently attempts to<br>
swallow. If a close examination is made the foreign body can be felt<br>
from the outside.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: For the removal of such obstructions, no special treatment is<br>
needed further than to use care and avoid any injury to the beak or<br>
throat. Feed nutritious food, as wheat bran mashes and vegetables and<br>
see that they have a liberal quantity of good pure water at all times.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
BLACKHEAD<br>
<br>
(Infectious Entero Hepatitis of Turkeys)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Due to a protozoa taken into the system with the food or drinking<br>
water. This parasite enters the caeca which becomes inflamed and<br>
discolored and the liver is enlarged and studded with yellowish spots<br>
about the size of a pea.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Although this disease is termed Blackhead, the discoloration<br>
of the head is not necessarily present in all cases; neither is this<br>
condition confined to this particular disease. One of the first symptoms<br>
is loss of appetite, followed in most cases by diarrhoea. The fowl<br>
becomes weak and loses weight rapidly. Examination of the liver after<br>
death will determine whether or not death has been caused by Infectious<br>
Entero Hepatitis. The dead birds should be burned to prevent the spread<br>
of the disease.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Prevention is one of the most important factors as this<br>
disease is very contagious and the protozoa once implanted in the turkey<br>
runs is almost impossible to eradicate. Provide clean, well ventilated<br>
coops and feed clean, wholesome food and good fresh water to drink.<br>
<br>
MEDICAL TREATMENT: Give Bismuth Salicylate and Quinine Sulphate each one<br>
grain two to three times a day. Also mix Hyposulphite of Soda in the<br>
proportion of two to four grains to every fowl in their drinking water<br>
twice daily. Disinfect coops and runs with Crude Carbolic Acid,<br>
undiluted.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
BODY LICE<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Insanitary conditions. Communicated by direct contact.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Young chicks become emaciated and die quickly. Older birds<br>
withstand the parasite much longer, but in time show signs of uneasiness<br>
by dusting themselves frequently. The comb and wattles become pale and<br>
bloodless, the feathers rough, dry and brittle. The birds grow weak,<br>
poor, and eventually die.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Dust the birds with the following: Sulphur, one part;<br>
Napthaline, one part; Tobacco Dust, twenty-eight parts and seventy parts<br>
of middlings. Powder finely and mix well together and dust the birds<br>
once daily. Also sprinkle freely in the dust baths.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
BRONCHITIS<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Exposure to dampness, cold drafts of air, inhaling irritating<br>
gases, vapors or dust. The fowls should be carefully examined, as<br>
bronchitis is occasionally caused by the presence of gapeworms.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Loss of appetite, the bird moves about slowly, breathing with<br>
difficulty and making a sort of whistling sound accompanied by a cough.<br>
As the disease progresses, there will be a peculiar bubbling sound from<br>
breathing due to an excessive accumulation of mucus in the windpipe. At<br>
this stage of the disease the bird becomes very weak and if not properly<br>
treated and cared for will rapidly lose strength, the feathers will<br>
become rough, head and wings droop, and the bird dies.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: This disease is most satisfactorily treated by placing the<br>
affected birds in warm, dry, well ventilated quarters, admitting<br>
sunlight if possible, but excluding all drafts of air. Feed stale bread,<br>
middlings, etc. Also place the fowls in a moderately air tight coop and<br>
compel them to inhale steam from hot water and Turpentine. This is<br>
readily done by placing the water and Turpentine in a pan and then<br>
insert a hot stone or brick in the solution. Force them to inhale this<br>
steam from twenty to thirty minutes twice a day. Also add Chlorate of<br>
Potash to their drinking water, one teaspoonful to every twenty-five<br>
aged fowls. To chicks add one-fourth teaspoonful to every twenty-five.<br>
If the weather is favorable and the above treatment is followed,<br>
bronchitis yields very favorably.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
BUMBLE FOOT<br>
<br>
(Corns-Deep Bruises-Abscesses)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Sharp-edged or narrow perches which bruise the feet or where the<br>
perches are high, heavy fowls often injure their feet by alighting on<br>
stones or other hard objects.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: The bird limps or hobbles about, moving with great difficulty.<br>
Examination will show the foot to be hot and tender to the touch.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Wash with clean, warm water and in some cases it is advisable<br>
to apply Hot Flaxseed poultices. When soft spots or abscesses develop,<br>
lance them with a clean, sharp knife. After abscesses and bruises are<br>
opened, treat them antiseptically by washing with a solution of Carbolic<br>
Acid, one teaspoonful to a pint of water. The foot should be bandaged to<br>
keep out dust and dirt.<br>

CATARRH<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Exposure; poorly constructed coops which admit rain or drafts.<br>
Weak birds are very susceptible to Catarrh.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: The bird is dull, moves about slowly, coughing or sneezing;<br>
appetite is poor, the mucous membrane of the air passage becomes<br>
inflamed and the breathing difficult, especially through the nose. The<br>
discharge from the nostrils at first watery, becomes mucus-like and<br>
thick and sticky, closing the nose, causing the bird to breathe wholly<br>
through the mouth with a wheezing sound.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: The cause of Catarrh shows the necessity of clean and<br>
comfortable quarters for the fowls. Keep the birds strong and vigorous<br>
by feeding clean, nourishing food.<br>
<br>
MEDICAL TREATMENT: To each fowl administer in their drinking water or<br>
feed: Chlorate of Potash, one grain, twice daily.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHICKEN POX<br>
<br>
(Sore Head--Warts)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: These diseases are due to low forms of parasites or fungi and<br>
occur most frequently in wet weather especially if the coops are leaky<br>
and allow the rain to fall on the droppings, causing mold or fungi. Poor<br>
ventilation and lack of light also promotes the growth of fungi.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: The disease is usually confined to the head and affects<br>
principally young chickens, pigeons and turkeys, but rarely ducks and<br>
geese. The infection appears in the form of yellowish warts or nodules<br>
about the nose, eyelids, comb, wattles, under the wings, or any<br>
unfeathered place. The warts vary in size from that of a pin head to the<br>
size of a pea and they discharge a fluid which at first is thin and<br>
watery but as the disease progresses, it becomes thick and sticky,<br>
yellow in color and fetid in smell. At this stage the appetite is poor,<br>
the feathers appear rough, and where the eyelids are affected, as in<br>
most cases, the bird cannot see, fails to eat, becomes emaciated, loses<br>
weight and strength rapidly and if not properly treated, dies.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: This disease is very contagious, therefore the coops and runs<br>
should be disinfected with Crude Carbolic Acid, undiluted. In the<br>
drinking water add Hyposulphite of Soda in the proportion of one to two<br>
grains to each fowl (one-half grain to chicks). Wash the nodules or<br>
warts about the head with Carbolic Acid solution, one teaspoonful to a<br>
quart of water. Feed easily digested food, such as vegetables or warm<br>
bran mashes.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CONGESTION OF THE LIVER<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Lack of exercise, overfeeding, tainted or moldy food, infection,<br>
or impure blood.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Birds suffering from this disease seldom show signs of<br>
sickness and it is well to dissect the fowl after death to ascertain the<br>
exact cause. If death is caused by Congestion of the Liver, the organ<br>
will be greatly enlarged and easily torn.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: If the fowls are fat and sluggish, compel them to exercise by<br>
driving them about. Also give fifteen to twenty grains of Epsom Salts to<br>
each affected fowl. Feed laxative foods that are easily digested, as<br>
vegetables and wheat bran mashes. They are cooling and relieve<br>
congestion.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CONGESTION OF THE LUNGS<br>
<br>
(Pulmonary Congestion)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Exposure; the bird chills, causing contraction of the blood<br>
vessels near the surface of the body, thereby forcing a large quantity<br>
of blood to the internal organs; the small blood vessels in the lungs<br>
become distended with blood and rupture.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Rapid and difficult breathing; the bird appears stupid and<br>
sleepy and docs not care to move about; appetite poor, wings drooping,<br>
plumage ruffled, a thick mucus, colored with blood, escapes from the<br>
mouth, comb and wattles show a dark-red color from lack of oxygen in the<br>
blood. This disease is of very short duration, the bird dying within a<br>
few hours. It is very common among young chicks and turkeys that are<br>
permitted to run out in the early spring rains.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Medical treatment is of no value, as the disease progresses<br>
so rapidly that the bird dies shortly after the first symptoms appear.<br>
Sanitary surroundings, good light, pure air and exercise are essential.<br>
Do not allow the birds to stand out in the cold or rains, especially<br>
during the molting season. Keep your poultry strong and vigorous by<br>
feeding clean, nourishing food and give them pure water to drink.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CONSTIPATION<br>
<br>
(Intestinal Obstruction)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Irritation of the membranes lining the intestines, caused by dry<br>
feed, glass or gravel; may also be due to parasitic worms. Obstruction<br>
may occur in any part of the intestines although the external opening is<br>
the part most frequently affected.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Bird appears dull and stupid, walks with difficulty and<br>
attempts frequently to expel the obstructing material. The appetite is<br>
poor and the feathers rough. By examination and manipulation the<br>
obstruction may be located. Dried masses of excrement by adhering to the<br>
feathers sometimes block the outer opening of the intestines.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Remove the waste matter clinging to the feathers with warm<br>
water or by clipping the feathers off. If the Cloaca is obstructed, give<br>
injections of Sweet Oil or Olive Oil with a small bulb syringe. Also<br>
give one to two grains of Calomel and feed clean food and soft mashes<br>
containing Pulv. Gentian Root, one grain to each fowl twice daily. This<br>
stimulates the worm-like movement of the bowels and assists in expelling<br>
their contents.<br>

CROP IMPACTION<br>
<br>
(Obstruction, Paralysis, Inflammation, Catarrh)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Errors in feeding; birds that are not fed regularly are<br>
predisposed to any of the above conditions; may also be due to<br>
swallowing large pieces of bone, thread, nails, pins, glass, gravel,<br>
etc.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Loss of appetite, frequent attempts to swallow, crop greatly<br>
distended and hard on pressure; eventually the food decomposes and a<br>
liquid may escape from the mouth and nose. The bird appears dull, stupid<br>
and sleepy, comb pale, feathers rough, beak open, owing to pressure on<br>
the windpipe. If caused by swallowing sharp objects, they may penetrate<br>
the crop and skin, causing a gangrenous condition. Grain in the crop<br>
will sometimes send out sprouts of considerable lengths.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: If no sharp objects are present, give two teaspoonfuls of<br>
Sweet or Olive Oil. This will lubricate the esophagus and crop.<br>
Manipulate the crop upward, forcing the food gently through the mouth,<br>
adding oil occasionally. If, however, sharp objects penetrate the crop<br>
it is best to remove them through an artificial opening. Clip the<br>
feathers from around the intended seat of operation and wash the clipped<br>
surface with a Carbolic Solution, one teaspoonful to a pint of water.<br>
The incision should not be over one-half inch long and should be made as<br>
high as possible and in the center of the crop. After removing the<br>
contents, sew up with ordinary thread and needle and wash occasionally<br>
with the above antiseptic solution. The operation is not difficult and<br>
will be successful if the parts are not too badly inflamed.<br>
<br>
After-treatment consists of feeding very little food until the crop is<br>
fairly well healed. Feed soft bran mashes and vegetables. To the<br>
drinking water add Boracic Acid, one grain, twice daily. It relieves the<br>
catarrhal condition that is present, such as irritations of the crop and<br>
intestines.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
DIARRHOEA<br>
<br>
(Gastro-Intestinal Catarrh--Enteritis)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Inflammation of the digestive organs can be traced in every<br>
instance to the quality or quantity of food and water consumed. The food<br>
or water may contain parasites, or large quantities of mustard, pepper,<br>
or may be moldy or tainted.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Loss of appetite, the feathers appear rough, the crop is<br>
sometimes paralyzed and distended with gas, the bird moves slowly, the<br>
droppings vary in color from a white to a yellow or a green and finally<br>
becomes tinged with blood; at this stage there is a rise in temperature<br>
accompanied by great thirst and signs of pain. Mild cases of simple<br>
diarrhoea if not properly treated when first symptoms appear, will<br>
develop the same severe conditions described above.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Determine the cause and remove it if possible. See that the<br>
food is clean and nutritious, the coops well ventilated, the runs well<br>
lighted. Sunlight is very beneficial. Avoid exposure, drafts and<br>
dampness. Place oatmeal in their drinking water, also give two grains of<br>
Bismuth mixed with dough and make into a small pill. Give one every six<br>
hours.<br>
<br>
When in addition to the above symptoms a bloody discharge is present,<br>
give six drops of Tincture of Catechu every four hours. Warm mashes made<br>
of bran or oatmeal are very nourishing and soothing to the intestinal<br>
canal.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
DIPHTHERITIC ROUP<br>
<br>
(Diphtheria)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Due to a specific germ. The disease is very contagious and is<br>
communicated by direct contact. Great care should be exercised,<br>
therefore, when showing or buying birds. Any new birds to be added to<br>
the flock should be kept in separate pens for a week or two to make sure<br>
they are in good condition.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: The first symptoms are similar to those of catarrh or cold. A<br>
clear, watery liquid escapes from the eyes and nostrils, the head is<br>
drawn in toward the body, the feathers appear rough, the breathing fast,<br>
the temperature rises from three to five degrees above normal. The bird<br>
walks about as if blind, sneezing, swallowing with difficulty, and<br>
showing signs of great weakness. If the mouth is opened small white<br>
spots or elevations will be seen on the back of the tongue. There may be<br>
diarrhoea of a green or yellow color. As the disease progresses the<br>
discharge from the nose and eyes becomes thick and stringy, obstructing<br>
the air passages and gathering in large quantities between the eyelids.<br>
The mouth, throat and tongue are very much inflamed and swollen and in<br>
most cases it is impossible for the bird to make a sound. Recovery is<br>
doubtful after the disease has reached this stage.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Isolate the affected birds in some clean, warm, light, well<br>
ventilated quarters, excluding drafts. Dissolve thirty grains of<br>
Chlorate of Potash in one ounce of water and one ounce of Glycerine, and<br>
to the average sized fowl give one teaspoonful three or four times a<br>
day. To chicks give one-fourth the dose. When the scum loosens in the<br>
back part of the tongue, remove the scum gently, Care should be taken so<br>
as to prevent bleeding. Feed soft, nourishing food.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
DOUBLE-YOLK EGGS<br>
<br>
Eggs are frequently found with two yolks. This condition is produced by<br>
two ovary capsules bursting at about the same time and gaining entrance<br>
together into the oviduct where they are concealed in the same shell.<br>
Double-yolked eggs are larger than normal and may injure the oviduct<br>
when expelled. When hatched, they produce twins or abnormal chicks.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
DROPSY<br>
<br>
(Ascites)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Generally due to irritating, indigestible food, causing<br>
inflammation of the membranous lining of the intestinal cavity.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: The abdomen becomes enlarged, is tender to the touch and<br>
contains a watery fluid, the movement of which can be heard in most<br>
cases by pressure on the swollen parts. The bird appears stupid, the<br>
comb pale and the appetite poor.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Unless the bird is very valuable, treatment is not advisable.<br>
In case the bird is valuable, give one grain of Potassium Iodide twice<br>
daily in the feed or drinking water. Also feed nourishing food as<br>
beef-scraps, vegetables, wheat bran mashes, etc.<br>
<br>

<br>
EGG BOUND<br>
<br>
(Difficult Laying; Obstruction of the Oviduct)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Due to the eggs being too large, the bird too fat, or to the<br>
absence of the secretions lubricating the oviduct.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: The first signs are scarcely noticeable but soon the feathers<br>
appear rough, the bird becomes dull and moves slowly, making frequent<br>
efforts to expel the egg.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Remove the egg by injecting Sweet Oil, assisting the bird<br>
with gentle pressure. In some cases it is well to puncture the egg and<br>
collapse the shell. If the bird is very fat, reduce by careful feeding.<br>
If the bird is of normal size, the trouble is probably due to the<br>
absence of lubricating secretions of the oviduct, in which case the<br>
following tonic should be given: Pulv. Ferri Sulphate, Pulv. Gentian<br>
Root, each one dram. Mix and make into thirty powders. Give one powder<br>
two or three times a day in their feed for a week or ten days.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
EGG EATING<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Is usually due to lack of shell-building material in the food; in<br>
such case the shell of the egg is thin and easily broken and the fowl<br>
craving the lime contained in the egg shell, naturally contracts the<br>
habit.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Supply ground bone and oyster shells. Feed green food such as<br>
cabbage, kale, potatoes, carrots, etc.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
EGGS WITHOUT SHELLS<br>
<br>
(Soft-Shelled Eggs)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Deficiency of shell material; or it is possible that fright<br>
sometimes causes premature expulsion of the eggs before the shell is<br>
formed.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Feed ground bone, oyster shells. They contain egg shell<br>
producing material. Perhaps the best results are obtained when mixed<br>
with wheat bran. Also feed vegetables such as cabbage, potatoes and<br>
carrots.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
FEATHER PULLING<br>
<br>
(Feather Eating)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Irritation of the skin due to lice, mites or to lack of exercise<br>
and improper food.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Feed meat, ground bones and vegetables. Place the food where<br>
the fowls are compelled to scratch and work to obtain it. Dust the fowls<br>
with Powdered Aloes.<br>
<br>
If due to lice, treat the same as recommended under the heading of Lice.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
GAPES<br>
<br>
(Verminous Tracheo Bronchitis)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: A red, parasitic worm, the male measuring about one-fifth of an<br>
inch and the female one-half an inch in length. Fowls become infected by<br>
eating worms containing this parasite or its eggs, and by coming in<br>
contact with other birds suffering from the disease.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: The most noticeable symptom is frequent gaping; the Gapeworms<br>
attach themselves by their months to the walls of the windpipe where<br>
they suck the blood which nourishes them; they cause irritation and<br>
inflammation of the windpipe, bronchial tubes and lungs; breathing is<br>
difficult and the bird loses strength rapidly; windpipe eventually<br>
becomes totally obstructed and the bird dies from suffocation and<br>
exhaustion. Young, weak chickens are more susceptible to this disease<br>
than strong ones.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Separate the sick birds from the healthy ones. Clean and<br>
disinfect the coops and runs. Burn all manure. Remove the worms from the<br>
windpipe by the use of a feather, from which the fan has been stripped,<br>
leaving only a small brush at the end. Dip the feather into Oil of<br>
Turpentine or Coal Oil, removing the surplus liquid by drawing the<br>
feather between the fingers. Now insert the feather into the windpipe of<br>
the bird and by turning gently you will dislodge the worms from their<br>
attachments. Repeat this treatment once a day for two or three days.<br>
Disinfect coops and runs with undiluted Crude Carbolic Acid. Feed good<br>
nutritious food as wheat bran mashes, etc.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
HEAD LICE<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Result of insanitary conditions and lack of care. Communicated by<br>
direct contact with infected birds, or by infected coops or brooders.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: The head soon becomes denuded of feathers, and also sore by<br>
being constantly scratched with the feet. If not properly treated the<br>
chicks weaken and die.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: An ointment made of one part Sulphur and four parts Lard well<br>
mixed and applied two to three times will exterminate the lice. If the<br>
fowl is run down in condition, feed good nutritious food as wheat bran<br>
mashes.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
HOW TO FEED YOUNG POULTRY<br>
<br>
Withhold all food for at least eighteen hours; then feed stale bread<br>
moistened with boiled milk every three hours. When they are three or<br>
four days old, feed rolled oats, ground corn moistened with pure water,<br>
finely chopped meat and boiled vegetables. Feed them often and you will<br>
be well repaid by their rapid growth, strength, and the low death rate.<br>
After they reach the age of one week or ten days, watch them closely and<br>
regulate their feed to their apparent needs.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
INCOMPLETE EGG<br>
<br>
(Abortion)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Irritation of the oviduct; improper secretion of albumen or<br>
internal egg-producing material.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Careful feeding will overcome this condition. Warm wheat bran<br>
mashes, ground bone, beef scraps, all tend to allay the irritations of<br>
the oviduct and stimulate the secretions of albumen.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
JAUNDICE<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Obstruction of the bile duct, due to rich, nitrogenous food and<br>
insufficient exercise.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Disease is not easily detected. The yellow color of the<br>
wattles and comb is the first symptom; the appetite is variable, the<br>
feathers appear rough and dry, the head is retracted, and the bird<br>
finally dies owing to the absorption of bile in the blood.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Change food. Feed upon a vegetable diet, also give one grain<br>
of Calomel, which is particularly useful in a case of sluggish liver in<br>
poultry. Also give one grain of Pulv. Gentian Root and one grain of<br>
Bicarbonate of Soda, twice daily in feed.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
MANGE<br>
<br>
(Scabies of the Body)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Due to a parasite that resembles the mite.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: When the affected bird is closely examined large quantities of<br>
scales or scabs are found in the soft feathers. The appetite is poor;<br>
the bird walks slowly about showing signs of uneasiness. If the disease<br>
is allowed to run its course, the bird grows weak and eventually dies.<br>
The disease is easily transmitted from one bird to another and should be<br>
treated without delay.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Disinfect roost, coops and pens with undiluted Crude Carbolic<br>
Acid. Apply to the irritations that present themselves on the body of<br>
the birds: Sulphur Ointment twice a week and feed good nourishing food<br>
as wheat bran mashes and vegetables.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
PIP<br>
<br>
(Inflammation of the Mouth)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Irritations, injuries, or micro-organisms. It is sometimes caused<br>
by nothing more than a dry condition of the mucous membrane due to the<br>
bird breathing through the mouth when suffering from respiratory<br>
diseases.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Dryness of the mucous membrane of the mouth; especially the<br>
part covering the tongue, which becomes hard and ragged, forming rough<br>
edges along its sides. These dried portions become loose and partially<br>
detached from the tongue, interfering with its movements and causing<br>
more or less pain and annoyance.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Do not forcibly detach these pieces, but assist nature to<br>
remove them. This can be accomplished by mixing Glycerine and Water,<br>
equal parts, and dropping into the mouth with an ordinary syringe or<br>
dropper. It is advisable to add Boracic Acid, one teaspoonful to every<br>
gallon of drinking water, which will prevent the entrance of parasites<br>
into the blood.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
RED MITE<br>
<br>
CAUSE: These grow spontaneously in favorable surroundings, as the<br>
interior of poultry houses and brooders containing numerous cracks and<br>
crevices.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: This mite is a blood-sucker; irritates the skin and sometimes<br>
causes sores to form on the body of the chick. The birds grow stupid and<br>
weak and die rapidly if not properly treated. Older fowls withstand the<br>
irritation of mites much longer, but do not thrive, or lay regularly,<br>
and will finally die if the insects become too numerous. The insect may<br>
be transmitted to horses, cattle, and even to man.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Paint the roosts and spray the interior of the coops and runs<br>
with Crude Carbolic Acid, undiluted, being very careful that the<br>
solution reaches the bottoms of the cracks and crevices. Also paint the<br>
interior of brooders with the same solution.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
RHEUMATISM<br>
<br>
(Leg Weakness--Gout--Paralysis)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Damp coops and pens, lack of ventilation and improper food.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Fowl refuses to stand or walk, and on examination, the legs<br>
are found to be swollen and painful, especially about the joints. In<br>
some cases suppuration of the joints takes place and they become open<br>
running sores. The bone finally becomes diseased and the fowl dies.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Preventive measures are first to be considered. See that the<br>
coops and pens are clean and dry. Avoid drafts. Feed vegetables, also<br>
wheat bran mashes. Give internally Salicylic Acid, one-half grain, twice<br>
daily. When the legs are swollen and sore apply Camphorated Ointment<br>
once or twice daily.<br>
<br>

PRIZE WINNING COLUMBIAN WYANDOTTE COCK.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
SCALY LEG<br>
<br>
(Scabies)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Due to a mite that burrows under the scales of the leg.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: White, scaly-looking scabs form about the upper part of the<br>
foot. The feet and legs become swollen and painful as the disease<br>
progresses and if not checked will result in lameness, inflammation of<br>
the joints, and the toes may slough off. Great care is necessary as the<br>
disease is very easily transmitted from one bird to another.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Use boiling water or Crude Carbolic Acid, undiluted, on the<br>
perches. Wash the feet and legs with warm water and soft soap. Dry well<br>
and apply Carbolated Ointment. Repeat the above treatment every other<br>
day for a week.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
SORE MOUTH<br>
<br>
(Aphtha; Thrush)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: A vegetable parasite called Oidium Albicans.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Inflammation of the mucous membrane lining the mouth, throat,<br>
gullet and crop, which finally terminates in white ulcerations. Other<br>
symptoms are swelling of the head, poor appetite and a rapid loss in<br>
weight and strength.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Isolate the sick from the healthy fowls. Give as much<br>
sunlight as possible, feed nourishing food, such as warm oatmeal mashes,<br>
kale, potatoes, etc. Add one grain each of Chlorate of Potash and<br>
Boracic Acid to a tablespoonful of water and give three or four times a<br>
day or oftener if they will drink it. A good disinfectant must be used<br>
to prevent the disease from spreading and I would recommend the use of<br>
undiluted Crude Carbolic Acid about the coops and poultry runs.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
TUBERCULOSIS<br>
<br>
CAUSE: This dreaded disease is caused by the Bacillus of Tuberculosis.<br>
Damp, ill-ventilated, and poorly lighted coops are favorable to the<br>
development of the disease.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Except in advanced stages, this disease is not easily detected<br>
as it affects various organs, and considerable experience in<br>
post-mortems and a skillful use of the microscope is required to<br>
successfully diagnose a case.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Preventive measures should be practiced as the disease is<br>
incurable. Do not expose the fowls to cold wet weather. See that the<br>
coops are well ventilated and lighted and feed no contaminated food.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
VENT GLEET<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Constipation is perhaps the most common cause, the hard droppings<br>
causing irritation of the vent which is followed by inflammation and<br>
suppuration of the lining membranes, rectum and oviduct.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: Frequent straining due to irritation. As the disease<br>
progresses a pus-like discharge is noticed. The disease may extend into<br>
the rectum or oviduct. The bird appears stupid, the plumage rough, the<br>
comb pale, and if not properly treated, dies a lingering death.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Preventive treatment is the best. Feed green food<br>
occasionally and warm bran mashes. This prevents constipation. When the<br>
bird strains frequently and a discharge is present the following<br>
solution should be injected: Sugar of Lead, two drams; Zinc Sulphate,<br>
one dram. Mix with two quarts of water. Inject about one ounce with a<br>
syringe twice daily until the discharge has ceased.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
WHITE DIARRHOEA<br>
<br>
(Fowl Cholera)<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Germ (Bacilli of Fowl Cholera) gaining entrance to the body<br>
through the bowels, lungs or wounds of the skin. Death results from<br>
toxic material produced while the germs are multiplying.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: All poultry, cage or wild birds are subject to this disease.<br>
The first symptoms are loss of appetite; diarrhoea is present and the<br>
discharge is almost white in color and tinged with transparent mucus.<br>
The affected bird becomes separated from the flock, seems weak and<br>
stupid and appears to be asleep; feathers are rough, the wings droop and<br>
the head is drawn in toward the body; crop is generally full, owing to<br>
improper digestion. The comb is pale and bloodless, the temperature<br>
raised from three to five degrees above normal and the bird loses weight<br>
rapidly; it may die with convulsions and cries, or without a sound or<br>
struggle.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: To grown fowls, give Zinc Sulphocarbolates in one-half grain<br>
doses three times a day in their food or drinking water. To chicks,<br>
dissolve thirty grains of Zinc Sulphocarbolates in two quarts of water.<br>
Saturate feed, as stale bread, etc., and give three times a day. Zinc<br>
Sulphocarbolates is an antiseptic especially prepared for septic<br>
conditions of the intestines, and very useful in treatment of White<br>
Diarrhoea and Fowl Cholera. In severe cases of diarrhoea, give Bismuth<br>
Salicylate, one grain, three times daily in feed or make into a pill<br>
with dough. When the fowls will eat, feed them clean, nitrogenous food<br>
that they can digest easily, as oatmeal mashes. It is also necessary to<br>
give them pure water to drink at all times. Disinfection of the premises<br>
is another essential factor in the treatment of this disease, and<br>
undiluted Crude Carbolic Acid is a disinfectant that we can rely upon at<br>
all times.<br>
<br>
I cannot recommend vaccination as the serum is very difficult and<br>
expensive to produce and different breeds of birds require varying<br>
doses, therefore, vaccinating poultry for White Diarrhoea or Fowl<br>
Cholera is not attended with any great degree of success.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
WORMS<br>
<br>
CAUSE: Few fowls are entirely free from worms. The soil over which the<br>
chicks are permitted to run may be infected, or the food may contain the<br>
eggs or embryos of worms.<br>
<br>
SYMPTOMS: The presence of worms in fowls may not be at once detected,<br>
since only a close observer would notice them in the droppings. If the<br>
birds eat well but remain poor, and the feathers appear rough and the<br>
comb and wattles pale, there is reason to suspect the existence of<br>
worms.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT: Preventive treatment is the best. Sprinkle the runs and coops<br>
regularly with Crude Carbolic Acid, undiluted. Give two drops of<br>
Turpentine in twice this quantity of Sweet or Olive Oil. This dose<br>
should be repeated in from six to eight days so as to insure the<br>
expulsion of the newly hatched worms or those that may have survived the<br>
first treatment.<br>

CHAPTER VI<br>
<br>
<br>
RESPIRATION<br>
<br>
The number of respirations per minute varies with the different classes<br>
of animals; as a rule, the larger the animal, the slower the<br>
respiration.<br>
<br>
The Horse&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8 to 10<br>
Cattle&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
12 to 15<br>
Sheep and Goats&nbsp;&nbsp; 12 to 20<br>
The Dog&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 15
to 20<br>
Swine&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
10 to 15<br>
<br>
The rate of breathing is increased from the processes of digestion<br>
immediately after eating, or may increase from exercise.<br>
<br>
NORMAL TEMPERATURE OF THE HORSE<br>
<br>
From&nbsp; 2 to&nbsp; 5 years old the temperature is 100.6 degrees Fahr.<br>
From&nbsp; 5 to 10 years old the temperature is 100.4 degrees Fahr.<br>
From 10 to 15 years old the temperature is 100&nbsp;&nbsp; degrees Fahr.<br>
From 15 to 20 years old the temperature is 98.4 to 100.2 degrees Fahr.<br>
<br>
Sex appears to slightly influence temperature:<br>
Stallion&nbsp;&nbsp; 100&nbsp;&nbsp; degrees Fahr.<br>
Mare&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 100.8 degrees Fahr.<br>
Gelding&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 100.4 degrees Fahr.<br>
<br>
The time of day when temperature is taken is important, the lowest body<br>
temperature being at 4 a.m., and the highest at 6 p.m. New born foals'<br>
temperature will run from 102 to 104 degrees Fahr.<br>
<br>
<br>
TEMPERATURE OF CATTLE<br>
<br>
Normal temperature is from 101.8 to 102 degrees Fahr.<br>
<br>
Compared with the horse, the daily variations are small.<br>
<br>
<br>
TEMPERATURE OF SHEEP AND GOATS<br>
<br>
In these animals the greatest variation in temperature occurs, viz.:<br>
100.9 to 105.8 degrees Fahr. In the majority of cases the temperature<br>
probably will be between 103.6 and 104.4 degrees Fahr. The cause of this<br>
variation is unknown.<br>
<br>
<br>
TEMPERATURE OF SWINE<br>
<br>
The average temperature is 103.3 degrees Fahr., varying from 100.9 to<br>
105.4 degrees Fahr.<br>
<br>
<br>
TEMPERATURE OF THE DOG<br>
<br>
The dog is subject to important variations depending on the external<br>
temperature; it varies from 99.5 to 101.7 degrees Fahr., although in<br>
some localities it is as high as 100.9, 101.3 and 101.7 degrees Fahr.<br>
Feeding will increase the temperature, and it is also higher toward<br>
evening.<br>
<br>
<br>
PULSE THROBS PER MINUTE<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Per Minute<br>
The Horse&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 36 to 40<br>
Cattle&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
45 to 50<br>
Sheep and Goats&nbsp;&nbsp; 70 to 80<br>
The Dog&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 70
to 80<br>
Swine&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
90 to 100<br>
<br>
The pulse in the young is much more rapid than in the adult animal; that<br>
of a foal at birth beats 100 to 102 per minute, while that of a calf<br>
will go to 130 per minute. In old age the pulsation becomes reduced and<br>
the arteries much weaker. The pulse rate in large animals is less than<br>
in smaller ones, as for instance, an elephant's pulse rate is from 25 to<br>
28 beats per minute. The more rapid the pulse, the greater the quantity<br>
of blood in circulation.<br>
<br>
<br>
AVERAGE PERIODS OF GESTATION OF DOMESTIC ANIMALS<br>
<br>
Mare&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11 months<br>
Ass&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 12 months<br>
Cow&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9 months<br>
Sheep&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5 months<br>
Goat&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5 months<br>
Sow&nbsp;&nbsp; 3-1/2 months<br>
Bitch&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9 weeks<br>
Cat&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8 weeks<br>
<br>
<br>
AVERAGE PERIOD OF INCUBATION<br>
<br>
Chicken&nbsp;&nbsp; 20 to 22 days<br>
Geese&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 28 to 34 days<br>
Duck&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 28 to 30 days<br>
Turkey&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 27 to 29 days<br>
Pigeon&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 18 days<br>
Guinea Fowl&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 28 days<br>
Pheasant&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 25 days<br>
Ostrich&nbsp;&nbsp; 40 to 42 days<br>
Canary Bird&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 14 days<br>
<br>
<br>
VETERINARY FACTS AND ADVICE TO REMEMBER<br>
<br>
1. Cleanliness of body and surroundings is a necessity in the treatment<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; of animals.<br>
<br>
2. Pure air, avoiding drafts, is equally essential.<br>
<br>
3. Light, excepting in the treatment of eye diseases, is greatly to be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; desired. Darkness, while soothing to the eye, tends to
prolong germ<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; life and disease.<br>
<br>
4. Keep dry--dampness breeds disease.<br>
<br>
5. Keep warm--in chilly weather, blanket the sick animal, hand rub limbs<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; and bandage with woolen cloths.<br>
<br>
6. Exercise with care--excessive and insufficient exercise are both<br>
injurious.<br>
<br>
7. Feed with care--green grass, in medium quantity, and vegetables are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; cooling to the blood, easily digested and exert a slight
laxative<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; effect. Grain feed is nutritious and strengthening, but it
is not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; required in any quantity by a horse not working. Be sure
that all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; feed is fresh and clean.<br>
<br>
8. Drinking water must be pure--impure water carries many disease germs.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Also avoid giving water in large quantities, especially if
water is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; very cold.<br>
<br>
9. Disinfection involves little time or expense, but is invaluable. Coal<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; tar products which emulsify in water (1 part coal tar
products to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 50-75 parts water) should be freely and occasionally
sprinkled about<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; yards and buildings.<br>
<br>
If only these few fundamental and common-sense principles were followed<br>
by stock raisers, a very large percentage of the ills and diseases of<br>
domestic animals would be lastingly prevented.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
DRENCHING<br>
<br>
Do not drench an animal when you can administer the necessary medicine<br>
in any other way. Drench only when absolutely necessary. A horse, in<br>
contrast with all other domestic animals, cannot breathe through its<br>
mouth. Therefore, in treating horses, drenching is especially dangerous.<br>
While drenching any animal, strangulation, pneumonia, bronchitis, etc.,<br>
are liable to be caused by some of the drenching liquid escaping from<br>
the mouth into the lungs. This is a frequent occurrence in which the<br>
drenching proves to be the immediate cause of the animal's death, as in<br>
case of strangulation, or the originating cause when drenched animals<br>
later succumb to pneumonia, bronchitis, etc.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
MEDICINE IN CAPSULES<br>
<br>
In many of the treatments prescribed in the preceding pages, the use of<br>
gelatine capsules has been advised in preference to giving the medicine<br>
in any other form.<br>
<br>
Capsules, made of gelatine, do not lie in the animal's stomach, as<br>
commonly supposed, but dissolve readily; the gelatine itself being<br>
beneficial in many cases, especially if the bowels or stomach be<br>
irritated. The animal receives the intended dose fully. It avoids any<br>
unpleasant taste. With capsule gun, or by hand, medicine in capsules is<br>
more easily and quickly given than to attempt to hold animal's head up,<br>
as is necessary when administering liquid drenches, the danger of which<br>
has been explained.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
PREVENTION OF CONTAGIOUS DISEASES<br>
<br>
Newly purchased animals or poultry should be segregated for from ten<br>
days to two weeks to give opportunity for any infectious diseases with<br>
which they may be afflicted, or have been exposed to, to fully develop.<br>
This precaution will often save the buyer from loss.<br>
<br>
Avoid exhibiting in fairs, shows, etc., where the health of your animals<br>
might be jeopardized, especially through the presence of contagiously<br>
affected animals. If you cannot be sure proper precautions are to be<br>
taken, better forego your pride and possible prize ribbons.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
HEREDITARY TENDENCIES<br>
<br>
When breeding, it is of utmost importance to select a good female as<br>
well as male, for the least faulty conformation in either will in all<br>
probability be transferred to the offspring, viz.: an animal with a<br>
crooked hind leg is subject to bone spavin, curbs, bog spavin,<br>
thoroughpin, ring bone, etc., and is liable to transmit any of these<br>
diseases, especially if exposed to slight exertion. A tubercular cow<br>
will invariably give birth to a tubercular calf, or at any rate the calf<br>
will contract tuberculosis from the milk.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
EVOLUTION OF STOCK<br>
<br>
During the transformation which our country has undergone, and is<br>
undergoing, no one industry has experienced such marked changes as the<br>
production and raising of livestock.<br>
<br>
At the earliest time of which we have any record, and even up to within<br>
comparatively recent years, large herds of horses and cattle ranged over<br>
our plains in a wild state. At first no attempts were made to capture or<br>
round up these herds, and later but one or two attempts per year, when<br>
the young were branded and grown animals shipped, if possible, or driven<br>
to available markets.<br>
<br>
As the country became more thickly settled and populated these larger<br>
herds were broken up, the ranges becoming divided and fenced. With this<br>
segregation, attention to breeding and care of animals began to be<br>
practiced, gradually causing the animal's evolution from the wild to the<br>
domesticated state.<br>
<br>
As this process of evolution progressed the animal became farther and<br>
farther removed from its natural condition of living, becoming more<br>
dependent on man for food and shelter, and with this change the animal's<br>
former vitality and power to resist disease decreased markedly.<br>
<br>
With the advancement of agriculture, and their resultant prosperity, the<br>
farmers and settlers improved their stock by importing blooded or<br>
registered males and females, particularly the former, until today our<br>
country is second to none in the number of good conformated draft and<br>
speed horses; beef and dairy cattle; quick-maturing hogs; large wool and<br>
mutton-producing sheep, etc. Poultry has likewise been improved for both<br>
egg-laying and meat-producing qualities. The poultry industry is yet in<br>
its infancy, and offers large inducements to the practical raiser. Our<br>
importation of eggs is enormous.<br>
<br>
The average stock raiser and poultryman has just begun to realize the<br>
value of proper care and treatment of his stock, and how much<br>
unnecessary loss can be prevented by the expenditure of a little time<br>
and even less money if given at the proper time.<br>
<br>
Animals and poultry are subject, just as humans, to many diseases but,<br>
unfortunately, when they become ill are dependent on man to recognize<br>
the symptoms of disease and diagnose. Therefore, it behooves all owners<br>
of stock to know and practice the fundamental necessities of their<br>
animals' health, not only for the welfare of themselves, but also as an<br>
act of humanity to dumb animals.<br>
